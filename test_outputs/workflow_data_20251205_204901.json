Baricitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor that interrupts the signaling pathway of IFN-\u03b3, a cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of LP.METHODSIn this phase II trial, 12 patients with cutaneous LP received 2 mg daily baricitinib for 16 weeks, accompanied by in-depth spatial, single-cell, and bulk transcriptomic profiling of pre- and posttreatment samples.RESULTSAn early and sustained clinical response was seen, with 83.3% of patients responsive at week 16. Our molecular data identified a unique, oligoclonal IFN-\u03b3, CD8+, and CXCL13+ cytotoxic T cell population in LP skin and demonstrated a rapid decrease in IFN signature within 2 weeks of treatment, most prominently in the basal layer of the epidermis.CONCLUSIONThis study demonstrates the efficacy and molecular mechanisms of JAK inhibition in LP.TRIAL REGISTRATIONNCT05188521FUNDINGEli Lilly, Appignani Benefactor Funds, 5P30AR075043, Mayo Clinic Clinical Trials Stimulus Funds.",

      "abstract": "The Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT signaling pathway is relevant in both Takayasu and giant cell arteritis (GCA), and the use of JAK inhibitors (JAKi) in arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease is nowadays common. Some evidence of the clinical efficacy of JAKi in GCA exists and a phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) of upadacitinib is currently recruiting. In 2017, we started using barcitinib in a GCA patient with inadequate response to corticosteroids, and later on, we treated other 14 GCA patients with baricitinib/tofacitinib during intense follow-up. The retrospective data of these 15 individuals are here summarized. GCA was diagnosed based on the ACR criteria and/or imaging techniques combined with increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) followed by a good initial response to corticosteroids. JAKi was initiated based on inflammatory activity, with increased CRP, presumably dependent on GCA with clinical symptoms, despite unsatisfying high doses of prednisolone. The mean age at JAKi initiation was 70.1 years and the mean exposure to JAKi was 19 months. From initiation, significant reductions in CRP were seen already at 3 (",

      "abstract": "In recent years, several new systemic agents (biologics and Janus kinase inhibitors [JAKi]) have been registered for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). However, comparisons of real-world drug survival data and insights into treatment patterns of these advanced systemics are limited. Data from a prospective observational single-centre registry were collected from 549 adult AD patients (759 treatment courses) receiving biologics (dupilumab, tralokinumab) or JAKi (abrocitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib) and analysed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate predictors of survival. Frequencies and percentages summarized data on the initial and subsequent treatments received, with a Sankey diagram illustrating the switching patterns. The 18-month overall drug survival rates for dupilumab, abrocitinib, upadacitinib, tralokinumab, and baricitinib were 70.0%, 51.5%, 48.4%, 39.4%, and 20.4%, respectively. No significant predictors for drug survival were identified. Dupilumab was the predominant initial treatment (87.2%) and upadacitinib the most frequently used second and third treatment. In the total cohort, 57.9% of patients remained on their initial treatment and 26.8% switched to other treatments. In conclusion, dupilumab showed superior survival rates while baricitinib had the lowest survival rate. Frequent switching highlights the need for biomarkers that predict response to advanced systemic treatments to improve attrition rates.",

The safety and efficacy of oral baricitinib for the treatment of LEP have not been studied. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of oral baricitinib in patients with LEP who are recalcitrant or intolerant to conventional therapies. Patients (aged \u226518\u2009years) with active LEP (with a revised cutaneous lupus erythematosus disease area and severity index [RCLASI]-active score\u2009\u22654] were randomly assigned 2:1 to baricitinib (4\u2009mg) or placebo (once daily for 20\u2009weeks). The placebo group was switched to baricitinib (4\u2009mg) at week 13, and the final evaluation was conducted at week 24. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an RCLASI-A\u2009score decreased by 20% at week 12. The secondary endpoints included the changes in the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index active-(CLASI-A) score, the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score, and safety. Five patients were enrolled. Three patients received baricitinib (4\u2009mg), and two patients were treated with placebo. Two patients in the baricitinib treatment group showed a significant RCLASI-A decrease at week 12 and week 24. Two patients in the placebo group had no change in RCLASI-A at week 12 and a significant decrease at week 24. No new safety events were observed. Treatment with baricitinib was effective and well tolerated in patients with LEP.",
