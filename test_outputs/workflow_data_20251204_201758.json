      "abstract": "Dysregulation of Janus kinase (JAK) pathways from uncontrolled cytokine signaling comprises the pathological basis for many complex inflammatory cutaneous disorders. Oral JAK inhibitors, upadacitinib, tofacitinib, and baricitinib targeting JAK 1 and JAK 1/3, respectively, are currently US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for several rheumatic conditions. However, studies have shown that JAK-mediated signaling pathways are involved in many immune-related dermatologic conditions. As a result, for recalcitrant diseases, JAK inhibitors are potential alternative therapies due to their broad targeted inhibitory mechanisms. In this case series, we present the successful off-label treatment of 6 cases across dermatomyositis, hidradenitis suppurativa, cutaneous lupus, and cutaneous Crohn&rsquo;s disease, which failed conventional therapies with upadacitinib or tofacitinib. In the 3 dermatomyositis cases, use of upadacitinib or tofacitinib demonstrated positive clinical outcomes, with no recurrent symptoms in cases where upadacitinib was used. In treatment-resistant hidradenitis suppurativa, upadacitinib demonstrated reduced systemic flares and moderate cutaneous symptom improvement. In the case of cutaneous Crohn&rsquo;s disease, upadacitinib resulted in reduced cutaneous symptoms without new flares. Tofacitinib resulted in completed resolution of cutaneous symptoms in our patient&rsquo;s case of cutaneous lupus erythematosus. JAK inhibitors upadacitinib and tofacitinib may be potential drug candidates in patients with treatment-resistant disease, especially in cases of inflammatory cutaneous conditions such as dermatomyositis, hidradenitis suppurativa, cutaneous lupus, and cutaneous Crohn&rsquo;s disease. Further studies with larger sample sizes among these conditions are warranted to assess potential broader applicability of the positive results demonstrated in our patient cases.

Some evidence of the clinical efficacy of JAKi in GCA exists and a phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) of upadacitinib is currently recruiting. In 2017, we started using barcitinib in a GCA patient with inadequate response to corticosteroids, and later on, we treated other 14 GCA patients with baricitinib/tofacitinib during intense follow-up. The retrospective data of these 15 individuals are here summarized. GCA was diagnosed based on the ACR criteria and/or imaging techniques combined with increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) followed by a good initial response to corticosteroids. JAKi was initiated based on inflammatory activity, with increased CRP, presumably dependent on GCA with clinical symptoms, despite unsatisfying high doses of prednisolone. The mean age at JAKi initiation was 70.1 years and the mean exposure to JAKi was 19 months. From initiation, significant reductions in CRP were seen already at 3 (",

These patients were treated with BARI due to either a refractory disease course or the unavailability of tocilizumab because of the pandemic. A total of six patients (five females and one male, median age 64 years, range 50-83) were treated with BARI. Two of them had isolated PMR, two had PMR with associated large vessel (LV)-GCA, one had LV-GCA presenting as fever of unknown origin, and one had cranial-GCA. All patients reported improvement with BARI. At the time of starting BARI, patients were taking a median prednisone dose of 8.75 mg/day (range 0-25), and the four patients with PMR had a median PMR-activity score of 23.3 (indicating high disease activity), which decreased to 1.58 after 6 months of treatment with BARI. Two of them could stop glucocorticoids (GC) and continue BARI monotherapy. One patient suffered from pneumonia, and BARI was therefore stopped. No other adverse events attributable to BARI were detected. Our case series supports previous reports suggesting the efficacy of Janus kinase inhibitors as a GC-sparing strategy in PMR and GCA.",

      "abstract": "Refractory pruritus is the most distressing, disease-related symptom in patients with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB), inducing an itch-scratch-blister cycle. Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of DEB, thus upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and Janus kinase (JAK) signaling may play a role in DEB-related pruritus. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of DEB patients with refractory pruritus who were treated with either baricitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, or upadacitinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor. Patients received baricitinib (4\u2009mg) or upadacitinib (15\u2009mg) once a day for 2-32\u2009weeks. A total of 12 DEB patients (six recessive DEB and six dominant DEB) were included in this study. The mean\u00b1SD baseline pruritus visual analog scale (VAS) score was 7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7. Upadacitinib or baricitinib treatment resulted in a rapid and sustained decrease in itch. Four out of 12 patients (33.3%) and seven out of 10 patients (70%) showed a decrease of at least 3 points in the pruritus VAS score from baseline at weeks 2 and 4, respectively. The mean percentage changes from baseline in pruritus VAS scores at weeks 2 and 4 were -42.9% and -52.7%, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed greater reductions in the pruritus VAS score in the baricitinib group (n\u2009=\u20095) compared to the upadacitinib group (n\u2009=\u20097), and in patients with epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (n\u2009=\u20093) compared to other subtypes of DEB (n\u2009=\u20099); however, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Three out of 10 (33.3%) patients showed at least a 2-point reduction in pain intensity from baseline at week 4. Eight out of 12 patients (66.7%) also showed a reduction in the number of new blisters, which correlated with a reduction in the pruritus score. No patient discontinued treatment because of serious adverse events. Our results suggest that JAK1 or JAK1/2 inhibitors could be a promising treatment option for DEB-related pruritus. Long-term safety should be assessed in future studies.",

      "abstract": "To present our preliminary experience with JAK inhibitors in treating patients affected by juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and associated uveitis. Case series. Four consecutive patients with long-term history of juvenile idiopathic arthritis and severe associated uveitis were included in the study. Indication for treatment with JAK inhibitors was uncontrolled arthritis and/or uveitis despite different treatments with conventional and biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). While on treatment with JAK inhibitors, namely, baricitinib (three cases) and tofacitinib (one case), all our patients showed improvement of uveitis defined as a reduction of intraocular inflammation according to Standardized Uveitis Nomenclature criteria. However, we observed a different response to treatment between the uveitis and the articular disease, as the latter did not respond as favorably as the former. Overall, the treatment was well tolerated by all patients and no ocular discomfort, ocular side effects, or allergic reactions were registered. JAK inhibitors may provide a new valuable treatment option in the therapeutic armamentarium for patients affected with JIA-associated uveitis, particularly in those refractory cases that are not adequately responding to conventional or biologic DMARDs.Key Points\u2022 A subset of patients with JIA uveitis either remain unresponsive or experience loss of efficacy\u2022 JAK inhibitors may provide a new valuable treatment option in JIA patients with uveitis\u2022 The safety profile was good with no occurrence of systemic side effects.",

      "abstract": "Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a recognized autoinflammatory disorder of unknown etiology. The standard initial management for AOSD includes conventional corticosteroids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. In cases that are resistant to these treatments, additional therapeutic options such as immunosuppressants, biologics, and other alternative treatments may be considered. Yet, a significant proportion of patients remain unresponsive to these therapeutic interventions. Herein, a case is reported involving a patient with AOSD who had persistent pruritic lesions that did not respond to conventional therapy, but were alleviated with Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi), namely baricitinib and upadacitinib. The objective is to expand the number of refractory AOSD cases treated with JAKi in clinical practice. Another aim is to offer potentially effective therapeutic options for AOSD patients who experience persistent pruritus.",
