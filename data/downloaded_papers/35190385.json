  "content": "Baricitinib for relapsing giant cell arteritis: a prospective open-label 52-week pilot study\n\nAbstract:\nBackground/Purpose: Pre-clinical vascular inflammation models have demonstrated effective suppression of arterial wall lesional T-cells through inhibition of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) and JAK1. However, JAK inhibition in patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) has not been prospectively investigated. Methods: We performed a prospective, open-label, pilot study of baricitinib (4mg/day) with a tiered glucocorticoid entry and accelerated taper in patients with relapsing GCA. Results: 15 patients were enrolled (11, 73% female) with a mean(SD) age at entry 72.4(7.2) years, median(IQR) duration of GCA of 9 (7, 21) months, and median of 1(1, 2) prior relapse. Four (27%) patients entered the study on prednisone 30 mg/day, 6 (40%) at 20 mg/day, and 5 (33%) at 10mg/day. Fourteen patients completed 52 weeks of baricitinib. At week 52, 14/15 (93%) patients had ≥1 adverse event with the most frequent events including: infection not requiring antibiotics (n=8), infection requiring antibiotics (n=5), nausea (n=6), leg swelling (n=2), fatigue (n=2), diarrhea (n=1). One subject required baricitinib discontinuation due to adverse event. One serious adverse event was recorded. Only 1 of 14 (7%) patients relapsed during the study. The remaining 13 patients achieved steroid discontinuation and remained in disease remission during the 52-week study duration. Conclusion: In this proof-of-concept study, baricitinib at 4 mg/day was well-tolerated and allowed glucocorticoid discontinuation in most patients with relapsing GCA. Larger randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the utility of JAK inhibition in GCA.\n\nFull Text:\n",
