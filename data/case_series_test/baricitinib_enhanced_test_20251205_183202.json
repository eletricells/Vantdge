      "abstract": "Purpose This study aimed to assess the efficacy of Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK-i) in the treatment of refractory isolated non-infectious uveitis. Case presentation We examined a case series involving three patients with isolated non-infectious uveitis, who were managed between December 2019 and December 2023 at The Eye Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana. The JAK-i therapy was initiated due to the patients\u2019 unresponsiveness to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Outcomes In our case series, two patients presented with anterior and intermediate uveitis, one with posterior uveitis. None of the patients had any associated systemic disease. After the initiation of JAK-I therapy, all the patients achieved remission lasting for more than 1 year. No significant side effects were observed in any of the patients throughout a mean follow-up period of 31.6 months (range, 16\u201355 months). Conclusion In this report, we present three cases of refractory isolated non-infectious uveitis successfully treated with JAK-i. This is the first report on the use of baricitinib and upadacitinib in this context. Our findings suggest that alternative use of JAK-i, apart from tofacitinib alone, may be an effective treatment option for such patients.",

      "title": "Baricitinib for juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a monocentric case series",
      "abstract": "Antitumour necrosis factor \u03b1 drugs dramatically changed the prognosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), the most common chronic rheumatic disease in childhood. Promising results from janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi), small molecules orally administered that inhibit specific receptor of the JAK family, are emerging. Tofacitinib, a nonselective JAKi, has shown an excellent efficacy in a recent randomised controlled trial(RCT) for polyarticular JIA. Baricitinib, a selective JAK 1 and JAK 2 inhibitor, resulted superior to placebo and adalimumab (ADA) in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Data are, however, scarce in JIA, and results from ongoing RCTs are still pending(NCT03773978, NCT03773965, NCT04088409). We, here, report four patients with polyarticular JIA children, fulfilling ILAR criteria, treated with baricitinib (4 mg) (table 1). All patients received an extensive infectious workup before drug starting. Patient 1 is a 13yearold Caucasian female with psoriatic arthritis, who previously obtained remission combining methotrexate (MTX) and ADA as methotrexate (MTX) alone resulted as failure. After 2 years of remission, a first attempt with intraarticular and systemic corticosteroid was not able to control a new flare in three joints and psoriasis worsened. Thus, ADA was discontinued and baricitinib started after proper washout. Clinical articular and cutaneous remission were achieved at 6 months and kept at last available followup of 12 months. Patient 2 is a 12yearsold Caucasian male with polyarticular JIA previously treated with MTX and etanercept for 12 months, Tocilizumab (8 mg/kg every 4 weeks intravenously) and MTX for 9. Since persistent activity baricitinib was started. At 12 months, he maintained a complete clinical remission. Patient 3 is a 16yearold LatinAmerican female with polyarticular RF+JIA. Since the onset at 7yearold, she received several unsuccessful treatments (table 1). Baricitinib was then started. She was not able to reduce corticosteroid dose beyond 10 mg/daily, and arthritis achieved just a partial control. Baricitinib was judged a failure (15 months) and abatacept started. Patient 4 is a 15yearold Caucasian male with polyarticularRF and ANA negative JIA. MTX was stopped due to gastrointestinal intolerance and leucopenia. Due to persistent arthritis, baricitinib was prescribed. At the last available followup (19 months), he is still on persistent remission. No adverse events occurred during observation period in all patients; one patient discontinued the drug for inefficacy. Based on previous reports, we checked JC and BK viruses in blood and urine. Nonetheless the approval for JIA has been received in Italy only in 2022, we attempted to prescribe baricitinib in selective, multiresistant, long history JIA children, based on its more selective profile compared with tofacitinib. A beneficial effect has been shown in threefourths of treated patients with an excellent safety profile in all of four. Data about baricitinib in paediatric age are few and mostly come from the use in rare diseases, as SAVI (STINGassociated vasculopathy with onset in infancy) and COPA syndrome, previously misdiagnosed as JIA. 5 Its beneficial outcome and safety profile was additionally showed in four patients with multidrug resistant juvenile dermatomyositis. Three additional adult patients with JIA associated uveitis achieved ocular but no articular remission on baricitinib. Recently, baricitinib has been used in four systemic JIA: one achieved complete clinical remission and two partial control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest case series of JIA paediatric patients treated with baricitinib, with good clinical outcome and safety profile. The limited number of included patients unable to identify predictors of response by a proper statistical analysis. Even though this is a small monocentric retrospective case series, this experience reports that baricitinib may represent a suitable therapeutic option for resistant forms of JIA, although its efficacy and safety should be formally demonstrated in an RCT. Stronger evidence is awaited from the upcoming baricitinib RCTs dedicated to JIA. Letter",

      "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of the article: Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a rare systemic necrotizing vasculitis preferentially targeting medium-sized arteries. PAN has two clinical entities: systemic PAN (sPAN) and cutaneous PAN (cPAN). cPAN is a skin-limited vasculitis, while ulcerative cPAN often predicts a higher risk of recurrence and a worse prognosis. However, there is still little experience and no consensus on cPAN treatment. Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) inhibition with baricitinib (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitor in patients with inflammatory skin diseases has demonstrated good therapeutic outcomes in several clinical studies. However, the use of baricitinib in patients with cPAN has not been reported to date. Materials and methods: We report the first case of cPAN successfully treated with baricitinib. The patient had previously undergone various treatments, including corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, but these were continually switched due to inadequate efficacy or significant side effects. Results: Following treatment with baricitinib, the patient\u2019s ulcers healed, subcutaneous nodules resolved, and livedo reticularis alleviated, resulting in a marked improvement in quality of life. No severe adverse reactions were observed during the treatment period. Over 1 year of follow-up, there was no recurrence of the rash. Conclusions: Our results support the evidence that baricitinib is a promising therapy for cPAN.",

      "title": "P05\u2003The role of JAK inhibitors in difficult-to-treat adult-onset Still\u2019s disease: a case series",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Adult-onset Still\u2019s Disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic auto-inflammatory disorder characterised by fever, arthritis and rash. Some patients with AOSD exhibit resistance or intolerance to conventional treatments, necessitating alternative therapeutic strategies. This case series aims to explore the efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors in managing difficult-to-treat AOSD. The driving force behind Still\u2019s disease lies in the excessive and inappropriate production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, notably IL-6 and interferon. Given the pivotal role of JAK inhibitors in mitigating these cytokine pathways, this study highlights their potential therapeutic impact in the management of difficult to treat AOSD. Case description In this retrospective case series, three adult patients with difficult-to-treat AOSD were evaluated for their response to JAK inhibitors, specifically tofacitinib and baricitinib. Case 1: A 32-year-old male presented with a three-week history of fevers, night sweats, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. Diagnosed with AOSD 18 months later, his treatment began with prednisolone and methotrexate, which was subsequently switched to azathioprine. Tocilizumab was then introduced, alleviating joint pain but causing dermatitis. He was switched to anakinra, allowing a reduction in prednisolone but failing to induce remission and resulting in abnormal liver functions and increased hepatitis B virus titers. Finally, he commenced tofacitinib, achieving symptom resolution, reduced serum ferritin levels, and cessation of steroids. Case 2: A 32-year-old woman presented with a six-month history of joint pain, swelling, stiffness, night sweats, weight loss, and a recurrent rash. Laboratory tests showed anemia, lymphopenia, elevated inflammatory markers, and high ferritin levels. Initial treatment with 60\u2009mg oral prednisolone showed some response, but polyarthritis necessitated further intervention. Anakinra initially managed systemic symptoms, though joint swelling persisted. Tocilizumab was tried but proved ineffective. Subsequently, transitioning to baricitinib at 4\u2009mg daily resulted in good symptomatic control. Case 3: An 18-year-old female presented with recurrent fevers, an intermittent macular rash, joint pains, diarrhoea and splenomegaly. Despite initial antibiotic treatment, persistent symptoms led to an AOSD diagnosis, prompting steroid therapy. Methotrexate failed to control symptoms and caused significant nausea, leading to a switch to tocilizumab. While anakinra initially resolved skin and joint symptoms, recurrent flares necessitated further changes. Azathioprine was trialed but discontinued due to side effects. Colchicine was tried next. Finally, tofacitinib was introduced, and one year later, she achieved significant progress, reducing prednisolone dosage to 5\u2009mg. Discussion The findings from this case series underscore the potential of JAK inhibitors, particularly tofacitinib and baricitinib, as effective treatments for refractory AOSD. In all three cases, patients showed substantial clinical improvement and were able to reduce or discontinue steroids. This suggests a promising role for JAK inhibitors in managing AOSD, especially given the disease\u2019s association with excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production, including IL-6 and IFN pathways. The transition to JAK inhibitors was often necessitated by inadequate responses or adverse effects from conventional therapies like methotrexate, azathioprine, and biologics such as tocilizumab and anakinra. The successful outcomes with JAK inhibitors highlight their ability to achieve disease control where other treatments failed, demonstrating their efficacy in reducing systemic inflammation and disease activity. Further research is warranted to establish optimal dosing, duration of therapy, and long-term safety profiles of JAK inhibitors in this patient population. These preliminary results are encouraging and suggest a new avenue for treating AOSD. Key learning points \u2022\u2003Efficacy of JAK inhibitors: JAK inhibitors, particularly tofacitinib and baricitinib, demonstrated substantial clinical improvement in patients with refractory AOSD. \u2022\u2003Steroid reduction: All three patients were able to reduce or discontinue steroid use, highlighting the potential of JAK inhibitors to minimise long-term steroid dependency. \u2022\u2003Management of refractory AOSD: JAK inhibitors provided effective disease control where conventional therapies such as methotrexate, azathioprine, and biologics like tocilizumab and anakinra were inadequate or resulted in adverse effects. \u2022\u2003Mechanism of action: The efficacy of JAK inhibitors may be attributed to their ability to block pro-inflammatory cytokine pathways, particularly IL-6 and IFN, which are crucial in AOSD pathogenesis. \u2022\u2003Safety profile: The treatment was well-tolerated, with significant symptomatic relief and no severe adverse events reported during the study period. \u2022\u2003Need for further research: There is a need for further prospective studies to determine the optimal dosing, duration of therapy, and long-term safety profiles of JAK inhibitors in AOSD patients. \u2022\u2003Personalised treatment approach: The study supports a personalised treatment approach, considering JAK inhibitors for patients with difficult-to-treat AOSD who do not respond adequately to conventional therapies.",

      "abstract": "As an inflammatory disease with a disrupted immune system, cytokine disorders in atopic dermatitis (AD) are closely related to the abnormal activation of JAK-STAT signal pathway. The critical relevance of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway to the pathogenesis of AD provides a strong rationale for JAK inhibitor research. Baricitinib, a small-molecule oral JAK inhibitor, has been proven to inhibit JAK-STAT signaling in a variety of diseases, including AD. It is currently available in China for off-label use. However, its efficacy in China and its mechanism are rarely reported. In our study, we found that the immune status of patients with moderate and severe AD was hyperactive. Among the 49 known immunotherapy targets, JAK1 and JAK2 genes on lymphocytes of AD patients were significantly upregulated, which was closely related to the symptom severity in moderate and severe AD patients. Baricitinib can improve immune hyperresponsiveness and clinical symptoms in moderate and severe AD by inhibiting the activation of Th2 cell subsets and the secretion of Th2-type cytokines through MAPK, mTOR and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, providing an important theoretical basis for clinical off-label use of Baricitinib to treat moderate and severe AD.",

      "abstract": "Polycythemia vera (PV) is a BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by excessive proliferation of erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic components in the bone marrow, mainly due to a Janus kinase 2 gene mutation (JAK2V617F). Givinostat, a histone-deacetylase inhibitor that selectively targets JAK2V617F cell growth, has demonstrated good efficacy and safety in three phase 1/2 studies in patients with PV. This manuscript focuses on the 4-year mean (2.8 year median) follow-up of an open-label, long-term study that enrolled 51 patients with PV (out of a total of 54 with MPN) who received clinical benefit from givinostat in these previous studies or on compassionate use, and who continued to receive givinostat at the last effective and tolerated dose. The primary objectives are to determine givinostat\u2019s long-term safety and tolerability, and efficacy evaluated by the investigators according to internationally recognized response criteria. During follow-up, only 10% of PV patients reported Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (AEs), while none had Grade 4 or 5 treatment-related AEs. The overall response rate for the duration of follow-up was always greater than 80% in patients with PV. In conclusion, givinostat demonstrated a good safety and efficacy profile in patients with PV, data supporting long-term use in this population.",

      "abstract": "Abstract BACKGROUND Off-label use of targeted therapy in pediatric Neuro Oncology is often offered to patients in the absence of available Clinical Trials specifically designed to this population. We present here six pediatric patients diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor who received compassionate treatment with targeted/novel therapy, alone or in combination, at disease progression or relapse, in a palliative setting. METHODS Retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor harboring a targeted molecular alteration, who received compassionate prescription of novel therapies not approved for the specific indication, and that were no eligible for a clinical trial. Patient demographics, dose of treatment delivered, tolerance, adverse effects, length of treatment, reason to discontinue the drug and survival rates were analyzed. RESULTS Four girls and two boys were identified; Median age at initiation of off-label drug: 4 years (3-17). Tumor type and targeted therapy delivered: DIPG H3 mutant (2), Diffuse Midline Glioma H3 and FGFR mutant (1), SHH-Medulloblastoma (1), ATRT (1), Diffusse Glioma EGFR and MET mutant (1). Off label drugs prescribed were ONC201, Erdafinitib, Sonidegib, Tazemetostat, and combination of crizotinib and erlotinib, respectively. Adverse events were mainly grade 1 and 2, however, 2/6 patients required hospital admission to manage adverse effects related to the experimental drug. One patient discontinued the drug due to side effects. All patients died of disease progression at a median of six months. CONCLUSIONS The anecdotical use of compassionate use of experimental drugs do not allow to gather clinical experience or to demonstrate a clinical benefit or impact in survival. Although the tolerance was generally good, the potential side effects caused by off-label drugs in a palliative population deserves a thorough individual assessment for its indication. Urgent need of targeted and novel therapies is warranted for pediatric children with malignant brain tumors.",

Luveltamab tazevibulin (luvelta) is an anti\u2013FR\u03b1-targeting antibody-drug conjugate with a stable cleavable linker and a 3-aminophenyl hemiasterlin warhead (DAR = 4), which induces cytotoxic and immunologic cell death.\n CBFA2T3::GLIS2\n AML uniquely expresses high cell surface levels of the FR\u03b1, suggesting that FR\u03b1-targeted therapies may be effective. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that treatment with luvelta can result in leukemia clearance. Preliminary safety and efficacy data from 25 children with relapsed/refractory\n CBFA2T3::GLIS2\n AML treated with luvelta via compassionate use are promising [Williams, et al, BLOOD 2023, 142 (1): 4295].\n Methods:\n This registration-enabling phase 1/2 study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT06679582) will investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety and preliminary efficacy of Luvelta in relapsed or refractory children with\n CBFA2T3::GLIS2\n AML and \u22655% bone marrow (BM) involvement by morphology. The\n CBFA2T3::GLIS2\n fusion will be confirmed at Foundation Medicine by next generation sequencing (NGS). The trial will open in up to 35 centers across US, Europe, Canada and Australia and is actively enrolling. The initial part of the trial will test luvelta monotherapy at 3.5 mg/kg or 4.3 mg/kg administered IV every 2 weeks in a 28-day cycle. Bayesian sequential monitoring is used for safety monitoring. The study committees will review the data to identify the recommended phase 2 dose of luvelta which will then be tested in the second part of the trial. Children who achieve BM morphological complete response (CR) may proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or continue single-agent luvelta for up to 2 years at the investigators\u2019 discretion. Patients without CR after 2 cycles of luvelta monotherapy may add chemotherapy (cytarabine +/- fludarabine or azacytidine) in cycle 3 and beyond. Post-HSCT maintenance therapy with luvelta monotherapy is also allowed for up to 2 years. The primary endpoint is morphologic CR defined as < 5% AML blasts in BM with absolute neutrophil recovery to > 1000 and platelets > 100,000 and absence of extramedullary disease. Secondary endpoints include PK levels and assessment of anti-drug antibody formation, safety, EFS and overall survival. Rates of measurable residual disease-negative CR and FR\u03b1 antigen levels pre- and post-luvelta will also be explored.\n \n Clinical trial information:\n NCT06679582\n \n .\n",

      "abstract": "Background\nIsocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is commonly mutated (mIDH) in gliomas, and this mutant enzyme produces the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). 2HG promotes gliomagenesis and is implicated in epileptogenesis. Ivosidenib (IVO), a small molecule oral mIDH1 inhibitor, is FDA-approved for mIDH1 newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Moreover, IVO has efficacy in clinical trials for recurrent mIDH1 gliomas. Given the lack of targeted treatments for gliomas, we initiated off-label IVO for mIDH glioma patients in October 2020.\n\n\nMethods\nRetrospectively, we sought to assess early outcomes in our patients and describe their experience on IVO from October 2020 through February 2022. Our objective was to report on the following variables of off-label use of IVO: radiographic response, seizure control, tolerability, and access to the medication. All patients initially received single-agent IVO dosed at 500 mg orally once daily.\n\n\nResults\nThe cohort age range was 21-74 years. Tumor types included astrocytoma (n = 14) and oligodendroglioma (n = 16), with most being grade 2 (n = 21). The best radiographic response in nonenhancing disease (n = 22) was 12 stable diseases, 5 minor responses, 3 partial responses, and 2 progressive diseases. Seizure frequency was stable to improved for most patients (70%, n = 21). IVO was well-tolerated, with the most common toxicities being diarrhea, elevated creatine kinase, and QTc interval prolongation. Most patients (66.7%, n = 20) received drugs via the patient assistance program, with insurance initially covering a third of patients and with ongoing use, later covering 60%.\n\n\nConclusions\nTargeted therapies like IVO are options for mIDH glioma patients and can provide positive oncologic and neurological outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome, a rare immune-mediated inflammatory disease, poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges owing to its multi-system involvement, high heterogeneity, and lack of specific laboratory tests. Additionally, lacking evidence-based treatment recommendations, with the primary approach focusing on symptomatic relief. Herein, we report the case of a 32-year-old Chinese woman who presented with recurrent, generalized multiple osteoarticular pain lasting over one year and skin erythema pustulosis for 11 months. Traditional treatments, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and other traditional approaches, yielded no significant effects. Despite the prior use of adalimumab and acitretin capsules, the treatment remained unsatisfying, especially regarding the skin lesions. Considering the complex pathogenesis of SAPHO syndrome, the patient was orally administered baricitinib (2 mg), a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, twice daily. A notable improvement in both skin lesions and osteoarticular pain was observed within two weeks of treatment initiation. Subsequently, the dosage of baricitinib was halved and continued for an additional three months, during which regular follow-ups revealed neither disease recurrence nor adverse effects. Collectively, the successful treatment of refractory SAPHO syndrome with baricitinib presents a promising implication for addressing the therapeutic challenges of this rare autoimmune condition, offering a potential breakthrough in managing its complex manifestations.",

Methods We performed a prospective cohort study in which baricitinib 4\u2009mg daily was prescribed to patients with refractory TAK, combined with oral glucocorticoids (GCs). Results 10 patients with refractory TAK were enrolled with a median age of 28 (IQR=22\u201337) years, median disease duration of 50 (IQR=24\u201365) months. The median dose of GCs was 10 (IQR=8.1\u201322.5)\u2009mg prednisone or equivalence dosage at baseline.

      "abstract": "Patients with steroid\u2010resistant or relapsed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) suffer increased bleeding risk and impaired quality of life. Baricitinib, an oral Janus\u2010associated kinases (JAK) inhibitor, could alleviate both innate and adaptive immune disorders without inducing thrombocytopenia in several autoimmune diseases. Accordingly, an open\u2010label, single\u2010arm, phase 2 trial (NCT05446831) was initiated to explore the safety and efficacy of baricitinib in ITP. Eligible patients were adults with primary ITP who were refractory to corticosteroids and at least one subsequent treatment, and had platelet counts below 30\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L at enrolment. Participants received baricitinib 4\u2009mg daily for 6\u2009months. The primary endpoint was durable response at the 6\u2010month follow\u2010up. A total of 35 patients were enrolled. Durable response was achieved in 20 patients (57.1%, 95% confidence interval, 39.9 to 74.4), and initial response in 23 (65.7%) patients. For patients responding to baricitinib, the median time to response was 12 (IQR 6\u201320) days, and the median peak platelet count was 94 (IQR 72\u2013128)\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L. Among the 27 patients undergoing extend observation, 12 (44.4%) remained responsive for a median duration of approximately 20\u2009weeks after baricitinib discontinuation. Adverse events were reported in 11 (31.4%) patients, including infections in 6 (17.1%) patients during the treatment period. Treatment discontinuation due to an adverse event was reported in 2 (5.7%) patients. Evidence from this pilot study suggested that baricitinib might be a novel candidate for the armamentarium of ITP\u2010modifying agents. Future studies are warranted to validate the safety, efficacy, and optimal dosing of baricitinib in patients with ITP.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objective Adult-onset Still\u2019s disease (AOSD) is an idiopathic systemic inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology. Some patients exhibit resistance to conventional treatment during long-term therapy. Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKinibs) may contribute to the improvement in AOSD symptoms via the JAK\u2013signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. We aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in patients with refractory AOSD. Methods Patients were enrolled if they fulfilled the Yamaguchi AOSD classification criteria in China between 2020 and 2022. All patients were recognized as having refractory AOSD and were treated with oral baricitinib at a dosage of 4\u00a0mg once daily. A systemic score and prednisone dosage were used to evaluate the efficacy of baricitinib at months 1, 3, and 6 and at the last follow-up visit. The safety profiles were recorded and analysed at every assessment. Results Seven female patients with refractory AOSD received baricitinib. The median age was 31 (IQR 10) years. Treatment was terminated in one patient due to progressive macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Others continued baricitinib treatment until the last assessment. The systemic score decreased significantly at 3 months ( p \u00a0=\u00a00 . 0216), 6 months ( p \u00a0=\u00a00.0007), and the last follow-up visit ( p \u00a0=\u00a00.0007) compared with baseline. One month after the initiation of baricitinib, the rates of improvement in fever, rash, sore throat, and myalgia symptoms were 71.4% (5/7), 40% (2/5), 80% (4/5), and 66.7% (2/3), respectively. Five patients remained symptom-free at the last follow-up visit. In most patients, their laboratory values had returned to normal by the last follow-up visit. A significant reduction in the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) ( p \u00a0=\u00a00.0165) and ferritin ( p \u00a0=\u00a00.0047) was observed at the last visit compared with baseline. The daily prednisolone dosage significantly decreased from 35.7\u00a0\u00b1 15.1\u00a0mg/day at baseline to 8.8\u00a0\u00b1 4.4\u00a0mg/day by month 6 ( p \u00a0=\u00a00.0256), and it was 5.8\u00a0\u00b1 4.7\u00a0mg/day at the last assessment ( p \u00a0=\u00a00.0030). Leukopenia due to MAS was noted in one patient. Except for mild abnormalities in lipid parameters, no other severe adverse events occurred during follow-up. Conclusions Our findings suggest that baricitinib therapy could provide rapid and durable clinical and laboratory improvement in patients with refractory AOSD. Treatment seemed to be well tolerated by these patients. The long-term efficacy and safety of baricitinib therapy for AOSD should be assessed further in prospective controlled clinical trials in the future.

Baricitinib, a selective Janus kinase 1 and 2 inhibitor, has been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and could reduce the disease severity in patients with livedoid vasculopathy. Methods We retrospectively observed eight patients who received 2 mg/day of baricitinib for the treatment of refractory livedoid vasculopathy. We evaluated their clinical scores before and after treatment to determine its effectiveness and safety. Results Improvement in livedoid vasculopathy was observed with significant regression in the clinical scores after baricitinib treatment. The mean clinical scores were 7.0 \u00b1 1.6 and 1.4 \u00b1 1.2 before and after baricitinib treatment, respectively (P <0.01). Furthermore, six out of the eight patients achieved a clinical score of 0 or 2 after treatment. These scores indicated remission. Clinical findings, including erythema, ulceration, and pain, improved in all the patients. The remission times ranged from 3 to 13 weeks, with a mean remission time of 7.75 \u00b1 3.45 weeks.

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in Takayasu arteritis (TAK) refractory to TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors. Methods We conducted a multicentre, single-arm trial between February 2021 and August 2023. Patients with TAK unresponsive to at least 6\u2009months of TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors were treated with baricitinib 4\u2009mg daily for up to 48\u2009weeks, while continuing of immunosuppressants and glucocorticoids. Clinical features, inflammatory parameters, imaging changes and treatment data were collected during follow-up. The primary end point was the overall response (ORR) (complete response [CR] plus partial response [PR]) at 24\u2009weeks. Results A total of 10 patients (nine female and one male) patients were enrolled, with median age of 29\u2009years (26.0, 35.3) and a median disease duration of 56.5\u2009months (31.8, 88.5). The ORR at 24\u2009weeks was 80%, with six patients achieving CR and two achieving PR. Disease progression was noted in the remaining two patients. Disease activity, ESR and CRP at 24\u2009weeks were significantly decreased compared with those at baseline. The median glucocorticoid dosage decreased from 20.0\u2009mg/day (15.0, 26.3) at baseline (P\u2009<\u20090.001) to 6.3\u2009mg/day (4.4, 10.6) at 24\u2009weeks.

The adverse effects (AEs) included upper respiratory tract infection (n\u2009=\u20092) and diarrhoea (n\u2009=\u20091), with no serious AEs reported. Conclusion Baricitinib is effective in patients with TAK resistant to conventional treatments and anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy and demonstrates a notable steroid-sparing effect.

      "abstract": "Objective To determine the short-term effectiveness safety of baricitinib in children with refractory and/or severe juvenile dermatomyositis (rsJDM) in a real-world setting. Methods This was a single-center retrospective study, including 20 children with rsJDM. They were all treated using baricitinib combined with steroids and other immunosuppressive agents. The childhood myositis assessment scale (CMAS) and PRINTO remission criteria were used to evaluate the disease severity and treatment outcome at 0, 4, 12, and 24 weeks after initiation of baricitinib. Results The skin rash improved in 95% of patients (19/20) at week 24, with a significant decrease of skin-DAS at weeks 12 (6.0 vs. 2.0, p < 0.05] and week 24 [6.0 vs. 1.0, p < 0.05) by median statistics. The CMAS score increased significantly at week 12 (41.0 [29.0, 44.0] vs. 46.0 [42.0, 52.0], p < 0.05) and week 24 (41.0 [29.0, 44.0] vs. 50.0 [45.0, 52.0], p < 0.05), as did the manual muscle testing (MMT)-8 score at week 24 (73.0 [610, 76.0] vs. 79.0 [77.0, 80.0], p < 0.05). At 24 weeks, the complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) were achieved in 75% (15/20) and 15% (3/20), respectively. The dose of corticosteroids (CS) decreased by 37% from the baseline (0.53 [0.42, 1.00] mg/kg) to week 12 (0.33 [0.18, 0.40] mg/kg) (p < 0.05), and by 49% at week 24 (p < 0.05). No serious side effects were observed. Conclusion Baricitinib combined with traditional immunosuppressants treatment was efficacious in rsJDM. Add-on therapy of baricitinib was helpful for tapering CS dose. No serious side effects were observed in this study.",

      "title": "Baseline Body Surface Area and Itch Severity Define Response to Baricitinib in Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis at Week 16",
      "abstract": "Introduction Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by heterogeneous clinical phenotypes and high symptom burden, especially through itch. Baricitinib (BARI), an oral Janus Kinase 1/2 inhibitor, is approved in Europe, Japan, and other countries, for treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapy. This post hoc analysis of a Phase 3 topical corticosteroid (TCS) combination therapy trial (BREEZE-AD7) aims to characterize patients who might benefit most from BARI. Method Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to identify baseline predictors for patients treated with BARI 4-mg, who achieved \u2265 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75), or EASI75 or Itch Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) \u2265 4-point improvement at week 16 (responders), versus non-responders. Subgroup efficacy analyses were performed based on identified predictor variables, combined with Itch NRS < 7/ \u2265 7. Missing data were imputed as non-responder. Results Baseline body surface area (BSA) was identified by CART as strongest variable predicting response to BARI at week 16, with a cut-off around 40% (BSA \u2264 40%). When combining BSA with itch severity, highest response rates were achieved by BARI patients with BSA \u2264 40%/Itch NRS \u2265 7 at baseline. In this subgroup, 69% and 58% of patients treated with BARI 4-mg achieved EASI75 and Itch NRS \u2265 4-point response at week 16, respectively. While these response rates were 65% and 50% for BARI 4-mg patients with baseline BSA \u2264 40%/Itch NRS < 7, they were 33% and 11% in BSA > 40%/Itch NRS < 7, and 32% and 49% in BSA > 40%/Itch NRS \u2265 7 subgroups, respectively. Conclusion Using a machine learning approach, patients with moderate-to-severe AD and a BSA affecting 10\u201340% and Itch NRS \u2265 7 were characterized as likely to benefit most from BARI 4-mg TCS combination therapy. This was confirmed by subgroup analyses, which showed that these patients are most likely to show favorable response rates in improving AD signs and symptoms, specifically itch, after 16 weeks of treatment.

We conducted a multicenter, retrospective and prospective study aimed at evaluating the long-term effectiveness and safety profile of baricitinib in the treatment of adult patients affected from AD, with the additional goal of identifying potential predictors of treatment response.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe included adult AD patients treated with baricitinib between January 2023 and November 2024 at five Italian tertiary centers. Disease severity and patient-reported outcomes, including the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Body Surface Area (BSA), Itch Numeric Rating Scale (Itch-NRS), Sleep Numeric Rating Scale (Sleep-NRS), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), and Minimal Disease Activity (MDA, defined as EASI \u22643 and Itch-NRS \u22641), were assessed at baseline and weeks 4, 16, 32, and 52.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 52 patients enrolled showed significant and sustained improvements in physician- (BSA, EASI) and patient-reported outcomes (Itch-NRS, Sleep-NRS, DLQI, POEM). At week 16, atopic comorbidities increased the odds of achieving MDA (OR: 10.9; p = 0.033), whereas head and neck involvement reduced the likelihood of response (OR: 0.07 p = 0.028). Thirty-two mild to moderate adverse events occurred in 28 patients, none requiring treatment discontinuation.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn this real-world study, baricitinib provided substantial long-term effectiveness with a favorable safety profile in moderate-to-severe AD, and atopic comorbidities emerged as a predictor of optimal clinical response at week 16.",

We present a case of refractory and severe BS that was treated with the Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKINIBS), Tofacitinib (TOFA) and then Baricitinib (BARI). Our aim was to describe the clinical and immunological outcomes after treatment with JAKINIBS. Blood tests and serum samples were obtained during follow-up with TOFA and BARI. We assessed their effects on clinical outcomes, acute phase reactants, absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs), lymphocyte subset counts, immunoglobulins, and cytokine levels. A review of the literature on the use of JAKINIBS for the treatment of uveitis and sarcoidosis was also conducted. TOFA led to a rapid and maintained disease control and a steroid-sparing effect. A decrease from baseline was observed in ALC, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and natural killer (NK) cell counts. B-cells were stable. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-4 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) increased, whereas IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 maintained stable. TOFA was discontinued after 19\u2009months due to significant lymphopenia. The initiation of BARI allowed maintaining adequate control of disease activity with an adequate safety profile.

The classic first line therapeutic management includes corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulins. Although it is less frequent in children than in adults, there is a significant percentage of patients, up to 47% according to the Pediatric and Adult Registry on Chronic ITP, who require second-line or further treatment, due to non-response to the first line treatment or persistence of disease, among other reasons. Several second line approaches for its treatment are currently in use, including increasing platelet production with thrombopoietin receptor agonists. We report the case of a 16-year-old patient with ITP and alopecia areata successfully treated with baricitinib, a reversible and selective JAK 1/2 inhibitor. Baricitinib is currently in use for the treatment of several autoimmune conditions and has been shown to increase platelet counts in these patients. This phenomenon has been linked to increased TPO signaling and reduced platelet destruction. There are promising preliminary results of adult ITP patients treated with baricitinib. This case report is the first reported use of baricitinib in ITP in the pediatric and adolescent setting, potentially leading to its use in this condition.",

      "title": "A qualitative evaluation of the specific carbohydrate diet for juvenile idiopathic arthritis based on children\u2019s and parents\u2019 experiences",
      "abstract": "Background Insights into the immunological role of the gastrointestinal tract in autoimmune conditions have led to the investigation of diet as a potential adjunctive treatment option for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) has shown promising results. However, studies on participants\u2019 experiences of dietary interventions in JIA are rare. In this study we investigated the experiences of children and parents\u2019 who had participated in a four-week intervention with SCD aiming to examine the potential anti-inflammatory effects. Objectives To conduct a qualitative evaluation exploring children\u2019s and parents\u2019 experiences of the dietary intervention, how they navigated challenges, and their support requirements. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 children and 15 parents from 13 families, who were interviewed individually and together. The transcripts were analysed using systematic text condensation. Results Most participants interviewed found the intervention beneficial, with 12 out of 13 reporting positive effects, such as reduced pain and morning stiffness, and improved gastrointestinal function. Many participants reported being willing to repeat the intervention in the current form. Despite facing challenges, all children followed the diet for one to three months, with some continuing to follow a modified version. Facing the socio-emotional consequences of adhering to the diet was challenging for children. These were handled by focusing on the positive aspects and by relying on the supportive environment available. Parents struggled with practical issues since the diet required hard work, time, and money. Areas identified as requiring additional support include finding simple, quick, and child-friendly solutions, strengthening organizational food skills such as meal planning, and preparation prior to starting the intervention regarding socio-emotional aspects. Conclusion Navigating the dietary treatment was considered challenging, practically for the parents and socio-emotionally for the children. Based on the reported challenges and participants\u2019 suggestions the intervention could be optimised by providing support and solutions in relation to the practical issues and better preparation regarding dealing with the socio-emotional consequences. Despite the difficulties, the participants reported overall positive experiences of, and attitudes towards, the current setup. Consequently, dietary interventions, such as the SCD, may be regarded as suitable targets for further research.",

      "abstract": "Background: The aim of the current research was to assess the clinical manifestations and diagnostic methods used in juvenile cases of Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH). \nMethods: This study employed a retrospective cross-sectional design to investigate pediatric patients diagnosed with AIH at Children\u2019s Medical Center Hospital, which is affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran. The study included patients who received routine examinations, treatments, and follow-ups during the period from 2018 to 2021. \nResults: The present investigation encompassed the evaluation of 52 pediatric patients, mostly female, with a mean age of 7.76 years. The vast majority of patients have encountered the occurrence of acute AIH. Positive findings for the Anti-Smooth Muscle Antibodies (ASMA) test were seen in 50% of the patients. The mean score for fibrosis in the observed individuals was 2.56, whereas the mean value for the Hepatitis Activity Index (HAI) in a subset of 29 patients was found to be 7.34. One patient succumbed to the condition, one case underwent transplantation, and another individual was identified as a candidate for liver transplantation. \nConclusion: Patients with AIH saw a decrease in long-term survival. There was no observed disparity in prognosis based on gender; nevertheless, it was noted that males had a shorter lifespan, perhaps attributable to an earlier beginning of the illness. The presence of cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis constituted a significant risk factor for unfavorable prognosis, as it was associated with an elevated overall risk of mortality owing to liver dysfunction.",

      "title": "The Potential Coexistence of Autoimmune Thyroid Diseases and Pediatric Vulvar Lichen sclerosus",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS), a chronic inflammatory skin disorder, often coexists with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). VLS presents with subtle symptoms including vulvar itching and discomfort. Clinically, a \u201cFigure 8\u201d pattern involving the labia minora, clitoral hood, and perianal region is often observed. It is prevalent both in pre-pubertal girls and women aged 40\u201360, and the link between VLS and AITD remains unclear, with proposed causes including autoimmune, hormonal or genetic factors, and environmental triggers. This study addresses the lack of research on the association in children, aiming to investigate the largest group of underage girls to date. Aim: This study aimed to investigate the coexistence of thyroid autoimmune diseases in girls diagnosed with vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) and to assess the presence of antibodies for specific thyroid autoimmune diseases. Materials and Methods: Our study was conducted from July 2020 to February 2021, involving a sample of 55 girls aged 2\u201318 years old, all free from systemic diseases. The study group comprised 20 girls previously diagnosed with vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS), while the control group included 35 girls without VLS. Legal guardians completed questionnaires detailing the medical history of their children. Blood samples were collected from all participants and subjected to biochemical analysis. The presence of human IgG antibodies against thyroid peroxidase and IgG antibodies against thyroglobulin was assessed using the immunoenzymatic method with commercially available ELISA kits. Results: In the study group, common symptoms included itching, soreness, burning sensation, excoriation, and erythema or pallor of the skin and perineal mucosa. An evaluation of anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies revealed no statistical significance between the study and control groups (anti-TG p = 0.379, anti-TPO p = 0.96). Family history of autoimmune diseases showed no significant correlation with anti-thyroid antibodies in girls. Although no significant relation between VLS occurrence and antibody levels was found, it emphasizes the need for multidisciplinary medical care. Further research with larger patient groups is necessary.",

      "abstract": "Autoimmune diseases are a heterogeneous group resulting from dysregulation or dysfunction of the immune system due to genetic predisposition and environmental triggers. It is common for these diseases to coexist. However, except for a single case secondary to varicella zoster virus infection, the association between juvenile idiopathic arthritis and acute cerebellitis has not been reported in the literature. A 9-year-old girl with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, initially presenting with symptoms of headache, nausea and vomiting, was diagnosed with diffuse bihemispheric acute cerebellitis by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Various tests were performed to determine the etiology of the disease. Infectious, metabolic, and autoimmune causes were excluded. This case report illustrates an ultra-rare association between juvenile idiopathic arthritis and acute cerebellitis, with a successful outcome following treatment and monitoring. There are 17 children, including our patient, who were followed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and were found to have central nervous system disorders in the literature. Cerebral vasculitis and optic neuritis were the most commonly diagnosed neurologic disorders. Biologic agents have been implicated in some cases of optic neuritis and aseptic meningitis. Prompt treatment with corticosteroids and discontinuation of suspected biologic agents leads to favorable outcomes. This literature review highlights that early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve outcomes.",

      "abstract": "JAK inhibitors (JAKi), small molecules that inhibit the Janus kinase enzymes, are increasingly used to treat children with rheumatologic diseases. Clinical experience of JAKi in the management of adult patients with pediatric-onset rheumatic conditions is still scarce.The aim of this study consists in evaluating efficacy and safety of JAKi in a monocentric cohort of adult patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).Clinical records of patients attending the rheumatology transition clinic at our centre were retrospectively reviewed; patients were included in case of: i) JIA diagnosis according to current classification criteria (1); ii) age \u226518 years and iii) treatment with JAKi for at least 3 months.17 patients that met the inclusion criteria were included in this study. Their demographics and clinical features are detailed inTable 1. 9 patients were treated with tofacitinib (52.9%) and 8 subjects (47.1%) received baricitinib. At 3 months, 4 patients (23.5%) achieved disease remission on JAKi: 3 patients achieving remission were treated with baricitinib and 1 with tofacitinib (37.5 vs. 16.7%, p=0.29). None of the patients with systemic JIA and enthesitis-related arthritis obtained remission; the remission rate at 3 months was higher, although not significantly, in the oligoarticular subset compared to the polyarticular subset (37.5 vs. 20%; p=1.0). Disease duration, age at onset and at JAKi start were similar between patients achieving remission and those with active disease (p=0.94, p=0.58 and p=0.72, respectively). Patients with \u22641 active joint involvement at JAKi start had higher remission rate (50 vs. 22.2%; p=0.58). Subjects who achieved remission on JAKi had a significantly lower pre-treatment DAS28 compared to those with still active disease (median DAS28 (IQR) 2.17 (1.9-2.4) and 4.54 (3.8-4.9), respectively; p=0.01, Mann-Whitney U=4). A pre-treatment DAS28 <3.76 predicted response to JAKi with 100% sensitivity and 84.6% specificity (AUC 0.88, p=0.02, 95%CI 0.71-1.05). Concomitant treatment with methotrexate did not significantly affect the remission rate (16.7 vs. 37.5%; p=1.0). This was lower among patients who had been treated with \u22652 biological drugs before JAKi start (9 vs. 66.7%; p=0.05). None of the patients developed side effects during JAKi treatment.JAKi could represent an effective and safe treatment option for adult JIA patients with low/moderate disease activity, particularly in case of oligoarticular involvement.[1]Petty RE, International League of Associations for Rheumatology classification of juvenile idiopathic arthritis: second revision, Edmonton, 2001.

      "abstract": "Background Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have substantial unmet medical need. Baricitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK)1 and 2 inhibitor that was shown to have therapeutic benefit in patients with SLE in a phase II clinical trial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the median change from baseline in conventional serologic biomarkers in subgroups and the overall population of baricitinib-treated patients with SLE, and the SLE Responder Index-4 (SRI-4) response by normalization of anti-dsDNA. Methods Data were assessed from the phase II trial I4V-MC-JAHH (NCT02708095). The median change from baseline in anti-dsDNA, IgG, and other conventional serologic markers was evaluated over time in patients who had elevated levels of markers at baseline, and in all patients for IgG. Median change from baseline for baricitinib treatments were compared with placebo. Among patients who were anti-dsDNA positive at baseline, SRI-4 responder rate was compared for those who stayed positive or achieved normal levels by week 24. Results Significant decreases of anti-dsDNA antibodies were observed in response to baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg compared to placebo beginning at weeks 2 (baricitinib 2 mg = \u2212 14.3 IU/mL, placebo = 0.1 IU/mL) and 4 (baricitinib 4 mg = \u2212 17.9 IU/mL, placebo = 0.02 IU/mL), respectively, continuing through week 24 (baricitinib 2 mg = \u2212 29.6 IU/mL, baricitinib 4 mg = \u2212 15.1 IU/mL, placebo=3.0 IU/mL). Significant reductions from baseline of IgG levels were found for baricitinib 4 mg-treated patients compared to placebo at weeks 12 (baricitinib 4 mg = \u2212 0.65 g/L, placebo = 0.09 g/L) and 24 (baricitinib 4 mg = \u2212 0.60 g/L, placebo = \u2212 0.04 g/L). For patients who were anti-dsDNA positive at baseline, no relationship between achieving SRI-4 responder and normalization of anti-dsDNA was observed by week 24. Conclusions Baricitinib treatment resulted in a rapid and sustained significant decrease in anti-dsDNA antibodies compared to placebo among those with positive anti-dsDNA antibodies at baseline, as well as a significant decrease in IgG levels in the 4 mg group at weeks 12 and 24. These data suggest that baricitinib may influence B cell activity in SLE. Further studies are needed to evaluate if reductions in anti-dsDNA levels with baricitinib treatment reflect the impact of baricitinib on B cell activity. Trial registration NCT02708095 .",

Some evidence of the clinical efficacy of JAKi in GCA exists and a phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) of upadacitinib is currently recruiting. In 2017, we started using barcitinib in a GCA patient with inadequate response to corticosteroids, and later on, we treated other 14 GCA patients with baricitinib/tofacitinib during intense follow-up. The retrospective data of these 15 individuals are here summarized. GCA was diagnosed based on the ACR criteria and/or imaging techniques combined with increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) followed by a good initial response to corticosteroids. JAKi was initiated based on inflammatory activity, with increased CRP, presumably dependent on GCA with clinical symptoms, despite unsatisfying high doses of prednisolone. The mean age at JAKi initiation was 70.1 years and the mean exposure to JAKi was 19 months. From initiation, significant reductions in CRP were seen already at 3 (",

      "abstract": "In recent years, several new systemic agents (biologics and Janus kinase inhibitors [JAKi]) have been registered for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). However, comparisons of real-world drug survival data and insights into treatment patterns of these advanced systemics are limited. Data from a prospective observational single-centre registry were collected from 549 adult AD patients (759 treatment courses) receiving biologics (dupilumab, tralokinumab) or JAKi (abrocitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib) and analysed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate predictors of survival. Frequencies and percentages summarized data on the initial and subsequent treatments received, with a Sankey diagram illustrating the switching patterns. The 18-month overall drug survival rates for dupilumab, abrocitinib, upadacitinib, tralokinumab, and baricitinib were 70.0%, 51.5%, 48.4%, 39.4%, and 20.4%, respectively. No significant predictors for drug survival were identified. Dupilumab was the predominant initial treatment (87.2%) and upadacitinib the most frequently used second and third treatment. In the total cohort, 57.9% of patients remained on their initial treatment and 26.8% switched to other treatments. In conclusion, dupilumab showed superior survival rates while baricitinib had the lowest survival rate. Frequent switching highlights the need for biomarkers that predict response to advanced systemic treatments to improve attrition rates.",

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an RCLASI-A\u2009score decreased by 20% at week 12. The secondary endpoints included the changes in the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index active-(CLASI-A) score, the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score, and safety. Five patients were enrolled. Three patients received baricitinib (4\u2009mg), and two patients were treated with placebo. Two patients in the baricitinib treatment group showed a significant RCLASI-A decrease at week 12 and week 24. Two patients in the placebo group had no change in RCLASI-A at week 12 and a significant decrease at week 24. No new safety events were observed.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Appropriate recommendations for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) should be carefully followed. A significant adverse effect can develop unexpectedly, and off-label drug use may control this adverse effect and other lupus manifestations. The current research in lupus relies solely on multiple composite outcome measures, which vary from one study to another. However, the optimal drug for a particular lupus symptom is presently unclear, requiring additional research for definitive clarification. CASE REPORT Here, we report a typical case of SLE in a 54-year-old Saudi female patient who presented with mucocutaneous symptoms and arthritis. She had a positive serology for antinuclear antibodies and anti-double-stranded DNA. Owing to the failure of conventional drugs, the use of belimumab resulted in significant improvements. She later developed worsening symptoms that progressed from alopecia areata (AA) to alopecia totalis (AT) and alopecia universalis (AU). She partially responded to systemic and local steroid injections. All measures to taper her steroid failed despite the use of azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate. Belimumab was stopped due to lack of efficacy. She was re-challenged with belimumab after she showed partial response to steroid therapy, but this clearly resulted in worsening of her hair loss to AT. The use of baricitinib following the second discontinuation of belimumab resulted in a significant improvement in AT and arthritis. CONCLUSIONS Our case offers valuable perspectives for future SLE research by concentrating on specific outcomes instead of composite outcome measures. The effectiveness of baricitinib should be investigated further in SLE.",

      "abstract": "Population pharmacokinetic (popPK) modeling was used to characterize the PK profile of the oral Janus kinase (JAK)1/JAK2 inhibitor, baricitinib, in 18 patients with Mendelian interferonopathies who are enrolled in a compassionate use program. Patients received doses between 0.1 to 17\u2009mg per day. Covariates of weight and renal function significantly influenced volume-of-distribution and clearance, respectively. The half-life of baricitinib in patients less than 40\u2009kg was substantially shorter than in adult populations, requiring the need for dosing up to 4 times daily. On therapeutic doses, the mean area-under-the-concentration-vs.-time curve was 2,388\u2009nM*hr, which is 1.83-fold higher than mean baricitinib exposures in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving doses of 4\u2009mg once-daily. Dose-dependent decreases in interferon (IFN) biomarkers confirmed an in vivo effect of baricitinib on type-1 IFN signaling. PopPK and pharmacodynamic data support a proposal for a weight- and estimated glomerular filtration rate-based dosing regimen in guiding baricitinib dosing in patients with rare interferonopathies.",

This study aimed to describe the drug survival, with associated predictors, of treatment with abrocitinib, baricitinib, cyclosporine, dupilumab, methotrexate, tralokinumab, and upadacitinib among patients with atopic dermatitis in Sweden who were recruited into the multicentre prospective SwedAD cohort between January 2017 and April 2024. A total of 1,194 patients were included with a total of 1,486 treatment episodes. The 2-year drug survival probability was 14.2% for baricitinib (treatment episodes, n\u2009=\u200930), 12.2% for cyclosporine (n\u2009=\u200940), 79.7% for dupilumab (n\u2009=\u20091,026), 45.4% for methotrexate (n\u2009=\u2009260), and 46.0% for upadacitinib (n\u2009=\u200989). Two-year follow-up data were not available for abrocitinib (n\u2009=\u200923) or tralokinumab (n\u2009=\u200918). All drugs were compared with the most used conventional systemic treatment at study baseline, methotrexate, using Cox regression. Only dupilumab showed a significantly lower hazard rate of drug discontinuation. In conclusion, dupilumab therapy demonstrated longer drug survival than methotrexate in atopic dermatitis. The impact of national treatment guidelines and time since drug approval should be considered when interpreting the results.",

      "abstract": "Anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 antibody-positive dermatomyositis (MDA5-DM) is associated with severe outcomes, primarily due to rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD), which is often refractory to standard therapies such as calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus) combined with cyclophosphamide (TC-Tx). This study evaluated the efficacy of a novel multitargeted regimen combining baricitinib, rituximab, and tacrolimus (BRT-Tx) in improving survival outcomes for MDA5-DM patients with poor prognostic factors.",
