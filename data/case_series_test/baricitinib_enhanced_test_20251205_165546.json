Baricitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor that interrupts the signaling pathway of IFN-\u03b3, a cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of LP.METHODSIn this phase II trial, 12 patients with cutaneous LP received 2 mg daily baricitinib for 16 weeks, accompanied by in-depth spatial, single-cell, and bulk transcriptomic profiling of pre- and posttreatment samples.RESULTSAn early and sustained clinical response was seen, with 83.3% of patients responsive at week 16. Our molecular data identified a unique, oligoclonal IFN-\u03b3, CD8+, and CXCL13+ cytotoxic T cell population in LP skin and demonstrated a rapid decrease in IFN signature within 2 weeks of treatment, most prominently in the basal layer of the epidermis.CONCLUSIONThis study demonstrates the efficacy and molecular mechanisms of JAK inhibition in LP.TRIAL REGISTRATIONNCT05188521FUNDINGEli Lilly, Appignani Benefactor Funds, 5P30AR075043, Mayo Clinic Clinical Trials Stimulus Funds.",

Some evidence of the clinical efficacy of JAKi in GCA exists and a phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) of upadacitinib is currently recruiting. In 2017, we started using barcitinib in a GCA patient with inadequate response to corticosteroids, and later on, we treated other 14 GCA patients with baricitinib/tofacitinib during intense follow-up. The retrospective data of these 15 individuals are here summarized. GCA was diagnosed based on the ACR criteria and/or imaging techniques combined with increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) followed by a good initial response to corticosteroids. JAKi was initiated based on inflammatory activity, with increased CRP, presumably dependent on GCA with clinical symptoms, despite unsatisfying high doses of prednisolone. The mean age at JAKi initiation was 70.1 years and the mean exposure to JAKi was 19 months. From initiation, significant reductions in CRP were seen already at 3 (",

      "abstract": "In recent years, several new systemic agents (biologics and Janus kinase inhibitors [JAKi]) have been registered for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). However, comparisons of real-world drug survival data and insights into treatment patterns of these advanced systemics are limited. Data from a prospective observational single-centre registry were collected from 549 adult AD patients (759 treatment courses) receiving biologics (dupilumab, tralokinumab) or JAKi (abrocitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib) and analysed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate predictors of survival. Frequencies and percentages summarized data on the initial and subsequent treatments received, with a Sankey diagram illustrating the switching patterns. The 18-month overall drug survival rates for dupilumab, abrocitinib, upadacitinib, tralokinumab, and baricitinib were 70.0%, 51.5%, 48.4%, 39.4%, and 20.4%, respectively. No significant predictors for drug survival were identified. Dupilumab was the predominant initial treatment (87.2%) and upadacitinib the most frequently used second and third treatment. In the total cohort, 57.9% of patients remained on their initial treatment and 26.8% switched to other treatments. In conclusion, dupilumab showed superior survival rates while baricitinib had the lowest survival rate. Frequent switching highlights the need for biomarkers that predict response to advanced systemic treatments to improve attrition rates.",

The safety and efficacy of oral baricitinib for the treatment of LEP have not been studied. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of oral baricitinib in patients with LEP who are recalcitrant or intolerant to conventional therapies. Patients (aged \u226518\u2009years) with active LEP (with a revised cutaneous lupus erythematosus disease area and severity index [RCLASI]-active score\u2009\u22654] were randomly assigned 2:1 to baricitinib (4\u2009mg) or placebo (once daily for 20\u2009weeks). The placebo group was switched to baricitinib (4\u2009mg) at week 13, and the final evaluation was conducted at week 24. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an RCLASI-A\u2009score decreased by 20% at week 12. The secondary endpoints included the changes in the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index active-(CLASI-A) score, the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score, and safety. Five patients were enrolled. Three patients received baricitinib (4\u2009mg), and two patients were treated with placebo. Two patients in the baricitinib treatment group showed a significant RCLASI-A decrease at week 12 and week 24. Two patients in the placebo group had no change in RCLASI-A at week 12 and a significant decrease at week 24. No new safety events were observed. Treatment with baricitinib was effective and well tolerated in patients with LEP.",

      "abstract": "Dysregulation of Janus kinase (JAK) pathways from uncontrolled cytokine signaling comprises the pathological basis for many complex inflammatory cutaneous disorders. Oral JAK inhibitors, upadacitinib, tofacitinib, and baricitinib targeting JAK 1 and JAK 1/3, respectively, are currently US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for several rheumatic conditions. However, studies have shown that JAK-mediated signaling pathways are involved in many immune-related dermatologic conditions. As a result, for recalcitrant diseases, JAK inhibitors are potential alternative therapies due to their broad targeted inhibitory mechanisms. In this case series, we present the successful off-label treatment of 6 cases across dermatomyositis, hidradenitis suppurativa, cutaneous lupus, and cutaneous Crohn&rsquo;s disease, which failed conventional therapies with upadacitinib or tofacitinib. In the 3 dermatomyositis cases, use of upadacitinib or tofacitinib demonstrated positive clinical outcomes, with no recurrent symptoms in cases where upadacitinib was used. In treatment-resistant hidradenitis suppurativa, upadacitinib demonstrated reduced systemic flares and moderate cutaneous symptom improvement. In the case of cutaneous Crohn&rsquo;s disease, upadacitinib resulted in reduced cutaneous symptoms without new flares. Tofacitinib resulted in completed resolution of cutaneous symptoms in our patient&rsquo;s case of cutaneous lupus erythematosus. JAK inhibitors upadacitinib and tofacitinib may be potential drug candidates in patients with treatment-resistant disease, especially in cases of inflammatory cutaneous conditions such as dermatomyositis, hidradenitis suppurativa, cutaneous lupus, and cutaneous Crohn&rsquo;s disease. Further studies with larger sample sizes among these conditions are warranted to assess potential broader applicability of the positive results demonstrated in our patient cases.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Appropriate recommendations for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) should be carefully followed. A significant adverse effect can develop unexpectedly, and off-label drug use may control this adverse effect and other lupus manifestations. The current research in lupus relies solely on multiple composite outcome measures, which vary from one study to another. However, the optimal drug for a particular lupus symptom is presently unclear, requiring additional research for definitive clarification. CASE REPORT Here, we report a typical case of SLE in a 54-year-old Saudi female patient who presented with mucocutaneous symptoms and arthritis. She had a positive serology for antinuclear antibodies and anti-double-stranded DNA. Owing to the failure of conventional drugs, the use of belimumab resulted in significant improvements. She later developed worsening symptoms that progressed from alopecia areata (AA) to alopecia totalis (AT) and alopecia universalis (AU). She partially responded to systemic and local steroid injections. All measures to taper her steroid failed despite the use of azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate. Belimumab was stopped due to lack of efficacy. She was re-challenged with belimumab after she showed partial response to steroid therapy, but this clearly resulted in worsening of her hair loss to AT. The use of baricitinib following the second discontinuation of belimumab resulted in a significant improvement in AT and arthritis. CONCLUSIONS Our case offers valuable perspectives for future SLE research by concentrating on specific outcomes instead of composite outcome measures. The effectiveness of baricitinib should be investigated further in SLE.",

      "abstract": "Population pharmacokinetic (popPK) modeling was used to characterize the PK profile of the oral Janus kinase (JAK)1/JAK2 inhibitor, baricitinib, in 18 patients with Mendelian interferonopathies who are enrolled in a compassionate use program. Patients received doses between 0.1 to 17\u2009mg per day. Covariates of weight and renal function significantly influenced volume-of-distribution and clearance, respectively. The half-life of baricitinib in patients less than 40\u2009kg was substantially shorter than in adult populations, requiring the need for dosing up to 4 times daily. On therapeutic doses, the mean area-under-the-concentration-vs.-time curve was 2,388\u2009nM*hr, which is 1.83-fold higher than mean baricitinib exposures in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving doses of 4\u2009mg once-daily. Dose-dependent decreases in interferon (IFN) biomarkers confirmed an in vivo effect of baricitinib on type-1 IFN signaling. PopPK and pharmacodynamic data support a proposal for a weight- and estimated glomerular filtration rate-based dosing regimen in guiding baricitinib dosing in patients with rare interferonopathies.",

This study aimed to describe the drug survival, with associated predictors, of treatment with abrocitinib, baricitinib, cyclosporine, dupilumab, methotrexate, tralokinumab, and upadacitinib among patients with atopic dermatitis in Sweden who were recruited into the multicentre prospective SwedAD cohort between January 2017 and April 2024. A total of 1,194 patients were included with a total of 1,486 treatment episodes. The 2-year drug survival probability was 14.2% for baricitinib (treatment episodes, n\u2009=\u200930), 12.2% for cyclosporine (n\u2009=\u200940), 79.7% for dupilumab (n\u2009=\u20091,026), 45.4% for methotrexate (n\u2009=\u2009260), and 46.0% for upadacitinib (n\u2009=\u200989). Two-year follow-up data were not available for abrocitinib (n\u2009=\u200923) or tralokinumab (n\u2009=\u200918). All drugs were compared with the most used conventional systemic treatment at study baseline, methotrexate, using Cox regression. Only dupilumab showed a significantly lower hazard rate of drug discontinuation. In conclusion, dupilumab therapy demonstrated longer drug survival than methotrexate in atopic dermatitis. The impact of national treatment guidelines and time since drug approval should be considered when interpreting the results.",

The Janus kinase/signal transduction and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway is a key pathway involving the pathogenesis of pSS. Baricitinib, a selective JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, has been approved for treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis and reported in treatment of some other autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus. We have found that baricitinib might be effective and safe in pSS in a pilot study. However, there is no published clinical evidence of baricitinib in pSS. Hence, we conducted this randomized study to further explore the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in pSS.",

We present a case of refractory and severe BS that was treated with the Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKINIBS), Tofacitinib (TOFA) and then Baricitinib (BARI). Our aim was to describe the clinical and immunological outcomes after treatment with JAKINIBS. Blood tests and serum samples were obtained during follow-up with TOFA and BARI. We assessed their effects on clinical outcomes, acute phase reactants, absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs), lymphocyte subset counts, immunoglobulins, and cytokine levels. A review of the literature on the use of JAKINIBS for the treatment of uveitis and sarcoidosis was also conducted. TOFA led to a rapid and maintained disease control and a steroid-sparing effect. A decrease from baseline was observed in ALC, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and natural killer (NK) cell counts. B-cells were stable. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-4 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) increased, whereas IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 maintained stable. TOFA was discontinued after 19\u2009months due to significant lymphopenia. The initiation of BARI allowed maintaining adequate control of disease activity with an adequate safety profile. The literature review showed seven patients with uveitis and five with sarcoidosis treated with JAKINIBS. No cases of BS treated with JAKINIBS were found. We report the successful use of JAKINIBS in a patient with refractory and severe BS.",

      "abstract": "Still\u2019s disease (SD) is a rare systemic autoinflammatory disorder of unknown etiology, clinically characterized by a triad of high-spiking fevers, an evanescent salmon-colored rash, and arthritis. The disease exhibits considerable heterogeneity, ranging from mild manifestations to severe, life-threatening complications such as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Management strategies are tailored according to disease severity, with glucocorticoids remaining the mainstay of treatment for moderate to severe cases. However, a subset of patients becomes glucocorticoid-dependent or refractory, necessitating the use of steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents. Recent advancements in biologic therapies have significantly improved disease outcomes and are increasingly adopted as first-line therapies. The Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK\u2013STAT) signaling pathway, known to be activated in various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, has emerged as a promising therapeutic target. Herein, we present a case of SD complicated by severe liver injury, which was successfully managed with baricitinib following the failure of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of the article: Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a rare systemic necrotizing vasculitis preferentially targeting medium-sized arteries. PAN has two clinical entities: systemic PAN (sPAN) and cutaneous PAN (cPAN). cPAN is a skin-limited vasculitis, while ulcerative cPAN often predicts a higher risk of recurrence and a worse prognosis. However, there is still little experience and no consensus on cPAN treatment. Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) inhibition with baricitinib (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitor in patients with inflammatory skin diseases has demonstrated good therapeutic outcomes in several clinical studies. However, the use of baricitinib in patients with cPAN has not been reported to date. Materials and methods: We report the first case of cPAN successfully treated with baricitinib. The patient had previously undergone various treatments, including corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, but these were continually switched due to inadequate efficacy or significant side effects. Results: Following treatment with baricitinib, the patient\u2019s ulcers healed, subcutaneous nodules resolved, and livedo reticularis alleviated, resulting in a marked improvement in quality of life. No severe adverse reactions were observed during the treatment period. Over 1 year of follow-up, there was no recurrence of the rash. Conclusions: Our results support the evidence that baricitinib is a promising therapy for cPAN.",

Patient concerns A 15-year-old boy had multiple rashes on the scalp accompanied by pain. Diagnosis The patient was diagnosed with PCAS or DCS based on the clinical manifestations and laboratory examinations. Interventions The patient was initially administered adalimumab 40\u2009mg biweekly and oral isotretinoin 30\u2009mg daily for 5\u2009months. Because the initial results were insufficient, the interval between adalimumab injections was extended to 4\u2009weeks, and isotretinoin was changed to baricitinib 4\u2009mg daily for 2\u2009months. When the condition became more stable, adalimumab 40\u2009mg and baricitinib 4\u2009mg were administered every 20 and 3\u2009days, respectively, for two more months until now. Outcomes After 9\u2009months of treatment and follow-up, the original skin lesions of the patient were almost cured, and most inflammatory alopecia patches disappeared. Conclusion Our literature review did not find any previous reports on treating PCAS with TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors and baricitinib. Accordingly, we presented the first successful treatment of PCAS with this regimen.",

      "abstract": "Adult-onset Still\u2019s disease (AOSD) is a recognized autoinflammatory disorder of unknown etiology. The standard initial management for AOSD includes conventional corticosteroids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. In cases that are resistant to these treatments, additional therapeutic options such as immunosuppressants, biologics, and other alternative treatments may be considered. Yet, a significant proportion of patients remain unresponsive to these therapeutic interventions. Herein, a case is reported involving a patient with AOSD who had persistent pruritic lesions that did not respond to conventional therapy, but were alleviated with Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi), namely baricitinib and upadacitinib. The objective is to expand the number of refractory AOSD cases treated with JAKi in clinical practice. Another aim is to offer potentially effective therapeutic options for AOSD patients who experience persistent pruritus. A case was reported involving AOSD characterized by persistent pruritic lesions that failed to respond to conventional treatment, but showed favorable outcomes with JAKi therapy. An analysis of the PubMed literature was performed to assess the medication\u2019s efficacy and explore possible mechanisms. The present case study is one of the few documented instances exploring the use of JAKi for treating AOSD, aligning with previously published research. After initiating JAKi therapy, the patient exhibited significant improvement in symptoms, most notably a reduction in persistent pruritus. Additionally, there was a substantial decrease in the patient\u2019s glucocorticoid dosage. Aside from minor renal function anomalies, no adverse reactions were observed. The present case illustrates that JAKi can provide rapid and sustained clinical improvement in patients with AOSD, especially those who have not responded to conventional treatment, and they have the ability to alleviate persistent itching. Further investigation is needed to ascertain the precise mechanism.",

Methods At week 52, responders and partial responders to baricitinib 4 mg were re-randomized (1:1) into the sub-study to dose continuation (4 mg, N = 84), or dose down-titration (2 mg, N = 84). Maintenance of response was assessed from week 52 to 104 of BREEZE-AD3. Physician-rated outcomes included vIGA-AD (0,1), EASI75, and mean change from baseline in EASI. Patient-reported outcomes included DLQI, P OEM total score, HADS, and from baseline: WPAI (presenteeism, absenteeism, overall work impairment, daily activity impairment) and change from baseline in SCORAD itch and sleep loss. Results With continuous treatment with baricitinib 4 mg, efficacy was maintained up to week 104 in vIGA-AD (0,1), EASI75, EASI mean change from baseline, SCORAD itch, SCORAD sleep loss, DLQI, P OEM, HADS, and WPAI (all scores).

Case presentation We examined a case series involving three patients with isolated non-infectious uveitis, who were managed between December 2019 and December 2023 at The Eye Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana. The JAK-i therapy was initiated due to the patients\u2019 unresponsiveness to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Outcomes In our case series, two patients presented with anterior and intermediate uveitis, one with posterior uveitis. None of the patients had any associated systemic disease. After the initiation of JAK-I therapy, all the patients achieved remission lasting for more than 1 year. No significant side effects were observed in any of the patients throughout a mean follow-up period of 31.6 months (range, 16\u201355 months). Conclusion In this report, we present three cases of refractory isolated non-infectious uveitis successfully treated with JAK-i. This is the first report on the use of baricitinib and upadacitinib in this context. Our findings suggest that alternative use of JAK-i, apart from tofacitinib alone, may be an effective treatment option for such patients.",

      "title": "Baricitinib for juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a monocentric case series",
      "abstract": "Antitumour necrosis factor \u03b1 drugs dramatically changed the prognosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), the most common chronic rheumatic disease in childhood. Promising results from janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi), small molecules orally administered that inhibit specific receptor of the JAK family, are emerging. Tofacitinib, a nonselective JAKi, has shown an excellent efficacy in a recent randomised controlled trial(RCT) for polyarticular JIA. Baricitinib, a selective JAK 1 and JAK 2 inhibitor, resulted superior to placebo and adalimumab (ADA) in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Data are, however, scarce in JIA, and results from ongoing RCTs are still pending(NCT03773978, NCT03773965, NCT04088409). We, here, report four patients with polyarticular JIA children, fulfilling ILAR criteria, treated with baricitinib (4 mg) (table 1). All patients received an extensive infectious workup before drug starting. Patient 1 is a 13yearold Caucasian female with psoriatic arthritis, who previously obtained remission combining methotrexate (MTX) and ADA as methotrexate (MTX) alone resulted as failure. After 2 years of remission, a first attempt with intraarticular and systemic corticosteroid was not able to control a new flare in three joints and psoriasis worsened. Thus, ADA was discontinued and baricitinib started after proper washout. Clinical articular and cutaneous remission were achieved at 6 months and kept at last available followup of 12 months. Patient 2 is a 12yearsold Caucasian male with polyarticular JIA previously treated with MTX and etanercept for 12 months, Tocilizumab (8 mg/kg every 4 weeks intravenously) and MTX for 9. Since persistent activity baricitinib was started. At 12 months, he maintained a complete clinical remission. Patient 3 is a 16yearold LatinAmerican female with polyarticular RF+JIA. Since the onset at 7yearold, she received several unsuccessful treatments (table 1). Baricitinib was then started. She was not able to reduce corticosteroid dose beyond 10 mg/daily, and arthritis achieved just a partial control. Baricitinib was judged a failure (15 months) and abatacept started. Patient 4 is a 15yearold Caucasian male with polyarticularRF and ANA negative JIA. MTX was stopped due to gastrointestinal intolerance and leucopenia. Due to persistent arthritis, baricitinib was prescribed. At the last available followup (19 months), he is still on persistent remission. No adverse events occurred during observation period in all patients; one patient discontinued the drug for inefficacy. Based on previous reports, we checked JC and BK viruses in blood and urine. Nonetheless the approval for JIA has been received in Italy only in 2022, we attempted to prescribe baricitinib in selective, multiresistant, long history JIA children, based on its more selective profile compared with tofacitinib. A beneficial effect has been shown in threefourths of treated patients with an excellent safety profile in all of four. Data about baricitinib in paediatric age are few and mostly come from the use in rare diseases, as SAVI (STINGassociated vasculopathy with onset in infancy) and COPA syndrome, previously misdiagnosed as JIA. 5 Its beneficial outcome and safety profile was additionally showed in four patients with multidrug resistant juvenile dermatomyositis. Three additional adult patients with JIA associated uveitis achieved ocular but no articular remission on baricitinib. Recently, baricitinib has been used in four systemic JIA: one achieved complete clinical remission and two partial control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest case series of JIA paediatric patients treated with baricitinib, with good clinical outcome and safety profile. The limited number of included patients unable to identify predictors of response by a proper statistical analysis. Even though this is a small monocentric retrospective case series, this experience reports that baricitinib may represent a suitable therapeutic option for resistant forms of JIA, although its efficacy and safety should be formally demonstrated in an RCT. Stronger evidence is awaited from the upcoming baricitinib RCTs dedicated to JIA. Letter",

      "title": "Baseline Body Surface Area and Itch Severity Define Response to Baricitinib in Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis at Week 16",
      "abstract": "Introduction Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by heterogeneous clinical phenotypes and high symptom burden, especially through itch. Baricitinib (BARI), an oral Janus Kinase 1/2 inhibitor, is approved in Europe, Japan, and other countries, for treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapy. This post hoc analysis of a Phase 3 topical corticosteroid (TCS) combination therapy trial (BREEZE-AD7) aims to characterize patients who might benefit most from BARI. Method Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to identify baseline predictors for patients treated with BARI 4-mg, who achieved \u2265 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75), or EASI75 or Itch Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) \u2265 4-point improvement at week 16 (responders), versus non-responders. Subgroup efficacy analyses were performed based on identified predictor variables, combined with Itch NRS < 7/ \u2265 7. Missing data were imputed as non-responder. Results Baseline body surface area (BSA) was identified by CART as strongest variable predicting response to BARI at week 16, with a cut-off around 40% (BSA \u2264 40%). When combining BSA with itch severity, highest response rates were achieved by BARI patients with BSA \u2264 40%/Itch NRS \u2265 7 at baseline. In this subgroup, 69% and 58% of patients treated with BARI 4-mg achieved EASI75 and Itch NRS \u2265 4-point response at week 16, respectively. While these response rates were 65% and 50% for BARI 4-mg patients with baseline BSA \u2264 40%/Itch NRS < 7, they were 33% and 11% in BSA > 40%/Itch NRS < 7, and 32% and 49% in BSA > 40%/Itch NRS \u2265 7 subgroups, respectively. Conclusion Using a machine learning approach, patients with moderate-to-severe AD and a BSA affecting 10\u201340% and Itch NRS \u2265 7 were characterized as likely to benefit most from BARI 4-mg TCS combination therapy. This was confirmed by subgroup analyses, which showed that these patients are most likely to show favorable response rates in improving AD signs and symptoms, specifically itch, after 16 weeks of treatment.

      "abstract": "Introduction: The treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients with insufficient response or intolerance to topical medication remains clinical challenges, and there is a paucity of head-to-head trials comparing the efficacy of novel biological agents such as JAK inhibitor and antibody. Methods: To compare the efficacy of selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor baricitinib and interleukin-4 monoclonal antibody dupilumab in the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe AD, a retrospective cohort study method was adopted. Clinical data from June 2020 to April 2022 were systematically reviewed. Eligible patients who received baricitinib or dupilumab were screened according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) age \u2265 18 years; (2) moderate-to-severe AD: baseline investigator global assessment (IGA) score \u2265 3, baseline eczema area and severity index (EASI) score \u2265 16; (3) poor response or intolerance to at least one topical drug in the past 6 months; (4) no topical glucocorticoids were used in the past 2 weeks and no systematic treatment was given in the past 4 weeks. Patients of the baricitinib group were treated with oral baricitinib in doses of 2 mg per day for 16 weeks, and patients of the dupilumab group were treated with standardized use of dupilumab for 16 weeks, with the initial 600 mg subcutaneous injection and the following 300 mg subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks. The clinical efficacy score indexes including the IGA score, EASI score, and Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score. These scores at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after the start of treatment were collected. Results: A total of 54/45 patients treated with baricitinib/dupilumab were included. There was no significant difference in the decrease of all scores between the two groups at the 4th week (p > 0.05). There was no difference in the EASI score and Itch NRS score (p > 0.05), but the IGA score of the baricitinib group was lower at the 16th week (Z = 4.284, p < 0.001). Within the first 4 weeks, the Itch NRS score of the baricitinib group decreased rapidly, but with the prolongation of treatment time, there was no significant difference between the two groups at the 16th week (Z = 1.721, p = 0.085). Conclusions: The efficacy of baricitinib at a dose of 2 mg daily was similar to dupilumab, and the improvement in pruritus was significantly faster in the early stage of treatment (the first 4 weeks) than that of dupilumab.",

      "abstract": "Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are novel treatment approaches for psoriasis. However, there is no direct comparison of JAK inhibitors in plaque psoriasis. In order to compare the efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors in psoriasis, we conducted a network meta\u2010analysis using eligible randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The efficacy of JAK inhibitors was evaluated using a 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75) from baseline, and the proportion of patients achieving the Physician\u2019s Global Assessment (PGA) response. The incidence of treatment\u2010related adverse events (AEs) was also assessed. A total of eight RCTs with tofacitinib, peficitinib, solcitinib, baricitinib, abrocitinib and deucravacitinib were included. A total of 3612 participants who were diagnosed with moderate\u2010to\u2010severe plaque psoriasis were analysed. Overall, JAK inhibitors showed superior PASI75 response over placebo at both 8 and 12\u2009weeks. Among all included JAK inhibitors, tofacitinib 15 mg twice a day (BID) had the highest probability of achieving PASI75 at both 8 and 12\u2009weeks (SUCRA\u2009=\u20090.938 and 0.937, separately), followed by tofacitinib 10 mg BID (SUCRA\u2009=\u20090.905 and 0.908, separately) and deucravacitinib 12 mg once daily (QD) (SUCRA\u2009=\u20090.874 and 0.837, separately). A similar finding was observed for PGA response. Safety assessment showed that all JAK inhibitors had non\u2010inferior safety compared with placebo, except for deucravacitinib 6 mg BID and 12 mg QD. Tofacitinib 2 mg BID was the first\u2010ranked drug for safety profile followed by deucravacitinib 3 mg QD, and tofacitinib 5 mg BID. When comprehensively evaluated the efficacy and safety, tofacitinib (2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg BID) was superior to other included JAK inhibitors with satisfying PASI75 and PGA response, as well as relatively low incidence of AEs. Our study confirmed that JAK inhibitors had promising treatment efficacy for moderate\u2010to\u2010severe plaque psoriasis. Tofacitinib showed superior efficacy and safety over peficitinib, solcitinib, baricitinib, abrocitinib and deucravacitinib.",

This report delineates primary diagnosis, indications for treatment, adverse events, and visual and anatomic outcomes after intravitreal brolucizumab. Methods A retrospective review of a consecutive clinical case series of 110 eyes treated with intravitreal brolucizumab between January 1st and March 1st. 2020. All patients were included if they received intravitreal brolucizumab in an off-label delivery and had ongoing macular edema in the setting of prior, multiple intravitreal anti-VEGF and/or intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide. All patients had spectral domain OCT documented before, at the time of, and in serial follow-up after intravitreal brolucizumab. Results Ninety-eight of 98 patients had marked decrease in macular edema. Indications for treatment were assigned to the primary etiologic diagnosis leading to the macular edema secondary to radiation retinopathy, complex epiretinal membrane, or complex diabetic retinopathy. In this series, sdOCT central point thickness decreased by an average of 71.5 microns, subretinal fluid resolved, and visual acuity was improved in 40% (greater than two Snellen lines) and stable in 60% (within two Snellen lines). No patient experienced a severe adverse event to specifically include vitritis and/or vasculitis. Conclusion In this series, brolucizumab intravitreal injection was associated with significant improvement in macular edema in each diagnostic category. No serious complications to treatment were found in this series. Brolucizumab, though associated with known intraocular inflammation and vasculitis, demonstrated marked benefit in these complex eyes previously unresponsive to aggressive intravitreal pharmacotherapy.",

      "title": "Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients Who Received Compassionate-Use Leronlimab",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Leronlimab, a monoclonal antibody blocker of C-C chemokine receptor type 5 originally developed to treat human immunodeficiency virus infection, was administered as an open-label compassionate-use therapeutic for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods Twenty-three hospitalized severe/critical COVID-19 patients received 700 mg leronlimab subcutaneously, repeated after 7 days in 17 of 23 patients still hospitalized. Eighteen of 23 received other experimental treatments, including convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, steroids, and/or tocilizumab. Five of 23 received leronlimab after blinded, placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir, sarilumab, selinexor, or tocilizumab. Outcomes and results were extracted from medical records. Results Mean age was 69.5\u2005\u00b1\u200514.9 years; 20 had significant comorbidities. At baseline, 22 were receiving supplemental oxygen (3 high flow, 7 mechanical ventilation). Blood showed markedly elevated inflammatory markers (ferritin, D-dimer, C-reactive protein) and an elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. By day 30 after initial dosing, 17 were recovered, 2 were still hospitalized, and 4 had died. Of the 7 intubated at baseline, 4 were fully recovered off oxygen, 2 were still hospitalized, and 1 had died. Conclusions Leronlimab appeared safe and well tolerated. The high recovery rate suggested benefit, and those with lower inflammatory markers had better outcomes. Some, but not all, patients appeared to have dramatic clinical responses, indicating that unknown factors may determine responsiveness to leronlimab. Routine inflammatory and cell prognostic markers did not markedly change immediately after treatment, although interleukin-6 tended to fall. In some persons, C-reactive protein clearly dropped only after the second leronlimab dose, suggesting that a higher loading dose might be more effective. Future controlled trials will be informative.",

After one year, mean percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1\u2005s increased by 10.3\u00b111.0 (\n p\n <0.0001) and 9.0\u00b110.7 percentage points (\n p\n <0.0001) compared to baseline in the at least one\n F508del\n and non-\n F508del\n predicted responsive group, and remained stable in the non-\n F508del\n predicted non-responsive group (p=0.31).
