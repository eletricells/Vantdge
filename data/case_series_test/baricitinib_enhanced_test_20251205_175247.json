      "abstract": "Background Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have substantial unmet medical need. Baricitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK)1 and 2 inhibitor that was shown to have therapeutic benefit in patients with SLE in a phase II clinical trial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the median change from baseline in conventional serologic biomarkers in subgroups and the overall population of baricitinib-treated patients with SLE, and the SLE Responder Index-4 (SRI-4) response by normalization of anti-dsDNA. Methods Data were assessed from the phase II trial I4V-MC-JAHH (NCT02708095). The median change from baseline in anti-dsDNA, IgG, and other conventional serologic markers was evaluated over time in patients who had elevated levels of markers at baseline, and in all patients for IgG. Median change from baseline for baricitinib treatments were compared with placebo. Among patients who were anti-dsDNA positive at baseline, SRI-4 responder rate was compared for those who stayed positive or achieved normal levels by week 24. Results Significant decreases of anti-dsDNA antibodies were observed in response to baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg compared to placebo beginning at weeks 2 (baricitinib 2 mg = \u2212 14.3 IU/mL, placebo = 0.1 IU/mL) and 4 (baricitinib 4 mg = \u2212 17.9 IU/mL, placebo = 0.02 IU/mL), respectively, continuing through week 24 (baricitinib 2 mg = \u2212 29.6 IU/mL, baricitinib 4 mg = \u2212 15.1 IU/mL, placebo=3.0 IU/mL). Significant reductions from baseline of IgG levels were found for baricitinib 4 mg-treated patients compared to placebo at weeks 12 (baricitinib 4 mg = \u2212 0.65 g/L, placebo = 0.09 g/L) and 24 (baricitinib 4 mg = \u2212 0.60 g/L, placebo = \u2212 0.04 g/L). For patients who were anti-dsDNA positive at baseline, no relationship between achieving SRI-4 responder and normalization of anti-dsDNA was observed by week 24. Conclusions Baricitinib treatment resulted in a rapid and sustained significant decrease in anti-dsDNA antibodies compared to placebo among those with positive anti-dsDNA antibodies at baseline, as well as a significant decrease in IgG levels in the 4 mg group at weeks 12 and 24. These data suggest that baricitinib may influence B cell activity in SLE. Further studies are needed to evaluate if reductions in anti-dsDNA levels with baricitinib treatment reflect the impact of baricitinib on B cell activity. Trial registration NCT02708095 .",

Baricitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor that interrupts the signaling pathway of IFN-\u03b3, a cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of LP.METHODSIn this phase II trial, 12 patients with cutaneous LP received 2 mg daily baricitinib for 16 weeks, accompanied by in-depth spatial, single-cell, and bulk transcriptomic profiling of pre- and posttreatment samples.RESULTSAn early and sustained clinical response was seen, with 83.3% of patients responsive at week 16. Our molecular data identified a unique, oligoclonal IFN-\u03b3, CD8+, and CXCL13+ cytotoxic T cell population in LP skin and demonstrated a rapid decrease in IFN signature within 2 weeks of treatment, most prominently in the basal layer of the epidermis.CONCLUSIONThis study demonstrates the efficacy and molecular mechanisms of JAK inhibition in LP.TRIAL REGISTRATIONNCT05188521FUNDINGEli Lilly, Appignani Benefactor Funds, 5P30AR075043, Mayo Clinic Clinical Trials Stimulus Funds.",

Some evidence of the clinical efficacy of JAKi in GCA exists and a phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) of upadacitinib is currently recruiting. In 2017, we started using barcitinib in a GCA patient with inadequate response to corticosteroids, and later on, we treated other 14 GCA patients with baricitinib/tofacitinib during intense follow-up. The retrospective data of these 15 individuals are here summarized. GCA was diagnosed based on the ACR criteria and/or imaging techniques combined with increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) followed by a good initial response to corticosteroids. JAKi was initiated based on inflammatory activity, with increased CRP, presumably dependent on GCA with clinical symptoms, despite unsatisfying high doses of prednisolone. The mean age at JAKi initiation was 70.1 years and the mean exposure to JAKi was 19 months. From initiation, significant reductions in CRP were seen already at 3 (",

Data from a prospective observational single-centre registry were collected from 549 adult AD patients (759 treatment courses) receiving biologics (dupilumab, tralokinumab) or JAKi (abrocitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib) and analysed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate predictors of survival. Frequencies and percentages summarized data on the initial and subsequent treatments received, with a Sankey diagram illustrating the switching patterns. The 18-month overall drug survival rates for dupilumab, abrocitinib, upadacitinib, tralokinumab, and baricitinib were 70.0%, 51.5%, 48.4%, 39.4%, and 20.4%, respectively. No significant predictors for drug survival were identified. Dupilumab was the predominant initial treatment (87.2%) and upadacitinib the most frequently used second and third treatment. In the total cohort, 57.9% of patients remained on their initial treatment and 26.8% switched to other treatments. In conclusion, dupilumab showed superior survival rates while baricitinib had the lowest survival rate. Frequent switching highlights the need for biomarkers that predict response to advanced systemic treatments to improve attrition rates.",

The safety and efficacy of oral baricitinib for the treatment of LEP have not been studied. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of oral baricitinib in patients with LEP who are recalcitrant or intolerant to conventional therapies. Patients (aged \u226518\u2009years) with active LEP (with a revised cutaneous lupus erythematosus disease area and severity index [RCLASI]-active score\u2009\u22654] were randomly assigned 2:1 to baricitinib (4\u2009mg) or placebo (once daily for 20\u2009weeks). The placebo group was switched to baricitinib (4\u2009mg) at week 13, and the final evaluation was conducted at week 24. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with an RCLASI-A\u2009score decreased by 20% at week 12. The secondary endpoints included the changes in the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index active-(CLASI-A) score, the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score, and safety. Five patients were enrolled. Three patients received baricitinib (4\u2009mg), and two patients were treated with placebo. Two patients in the baricitinib treatment group showed a significant RCLASI-A decrease at week 12 and week 24. Two patients in the placebo group had no change in RCLASI-A at week 12 and a significant decrease at week 24. No new safety events were observed. Treatment with baricitinib was effective and well tolerated in patients with LEP.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Appropriate recommendations for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) should be carefully followed. A significant adverse effect can develop unexpectedly, and off-label drug use may control this adverse effect and other lupus manifestations. The current research in lupus relies solely on multiple composite outcome measures, which vary from one study to another. However, the optimal drug for a particular lupus symptom is presently unclear, requiring additional research for definitive clarification. CASE REPORT Here, we report a typical case of SLE in a 54-year-old Saudi female patient who presented with mucocutaneous symptoms and arthritis. She had a positive serology for antinuclear antibodies and anti-double-stranded DNA. Owing to the failure of conventional drugs, the use of belimumab resulted in significant improvements. She later developed worsening symptoms that progressed from alopecia areata (AA) to alopecia totalis (AT) and alopecia universalis (AU). She partially responded to systemic and local steroid injections. All measures to taper her steroid failed despite the use of azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate. Belimumab was stopped due to lack of efficacy. She was re-challenged with belimumab after she showed partial response to steroid therapy, but this clearly resulted in worsening of her hair loss to AT. The use of baricitinib following the second discontinuation of belimumab resulted in a significant improvement in AT and arthritis. CONCLUSIONS Our case offers valuable perspectives for future SLE research by concentrating on specific outcomes instead of composite outcome measures. The effectiveness of baricitinib should be investigated further in SLE.",

This study aimed to describe the drug survival, with associated predictors, of treatment with abrocitinib, baricitinib, cyclosporine, dupilumab, methotrexate, tralokinumab, and upadacitinib among patients with atopic dermatitis in Sweden who were recruited into the multicentre prospective SwedAD cohort between January 2017 and April 2024. A total of 1,194 patients were included with a total of 1,486 treatment episodes. The 2-year drug survival probability was 14.2% for baricitinib (treatment episodes, n\u2009=\u200930), 12.2% for cyclosporine (n\u2009=\u200940), 79.7% for dupilumab (n\u2009=\u20091,026), 45.4% for methotrexate (n\u2009=\u2009260), and 46.0% for upadacitinib (n\u2009=\u200989). Two-year follow-up data were not available for abrocitinib (n\u2009=\u200923) or tralokinumab (n\u2009=\u200918). All drugs were compared with the most used conventional systemic treatment at study baseline, methotrexate, using Cox regression. Only dupilumab showed a significantly lower hazard rate of drug discontinuation. In conclusion, dupilumab therapy demonstrated longer drug survival than methotrexate in atopic dermatitis. The impact of national treatment guidelines and time since drug approval should be considered when interpreting the results.",

      "title": "Evaluating the Usage of Janus Kinase Inhibitors in Rheumatology and Its Impact on Cardiovascular Risk.",
      "abstract": "Background/purpose Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been widely used in treating rheumatological conditions like rheumatoid arthritis\u00a0(RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Despite their efficacy, there are concerns regarding major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with JAK inhibitors. This study aimed to evaluate the risk of MACE, VTE, and the impact on lipid profiles in patients being treated with JAK inhibitors. Methods We retrospectively reviewed electronic medical records of patients aged 45-65 years old treated with Tofacitinib, Baricitinib, or Upadacitinib in a rheumatology clinic. We collected data on demographics, comorbidities, medication use, laboratory results, and cardiac complications potentially related to JAK inhibitors. Results Among 100 patients prescribed JAK inhibitors, 71 were included in the study (with an average treatment duration of 2.5 years). The majority of patients were white (72%), followed by Hispanic (6%), Indian (11%), African American (10%), and Asian (1%). Patients were being treated primarily for RA (57%), followed by PsA (17%), colitis (20%), and alopecia areata (6%). There were no significant cases of VTE reported, with one patient developing a pulmonary embolism (PE) during treatment while also having COVID-19, making it difficult to attribute it solely to the medication. Similarly, only one case of atrial fibrillation occurred. However, 43% (31 patients) experienced worsening of their lipid profile, with increased cholesterol (18%), LDL (12.5%), both LDL and cholesterol (11%)\u00a0or triglycerides (1.5%). In relation to diabetes mellitus (DM), 24 patients who experienced worsening of their lipid panel did not have a history of DM. Conclusion The study findings suggest that patients on Tofacitinib, Baricitinib, and Upadacitinib did not exhibit a high risk for MACE or DVT. However, there was a notable incidence of lipid panel worsening among patients, where 24 patients out of 31 did not have\u00a0diabetes. Further research and monitoring may be needed to better understand the long-term effects of JAK inhibitors on cardiovascular health and lipid profiles in these patient populations. This real-world data reflects the current evidence that JAK inhibitors do not significantly raise the risk of MACE in patients with RA\u00a0but do increase cholesterol levels in these patients that should be monitored closely.",

Case presentation We examined a case series involving three patients with isolated non-infectious uveitis, who were managed between December 2019 and December 2023 at The Eye Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana. The JAK-i therapy was initiated due to the patients\u2019 unresponsiveness to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Outcomes In our case series, two patients presented with anterior and intermediate uveitis, one with posterior uveitis. None of the patients had any associated systemic disease. After the initiation of JAK-I therapy, all the patients achieved remission lasting for more than 1 year. No significant side effects were observed in any of the patients throughout a mean follow-up period of 31.6 months (range, 16\u201355 months). Conclusion In this report, we present three cases of refractory isolated non-infectious uveitis successfully treated with JAK-i. This is the first report on the use of baricitinib and upadacitinib in this context. Our findings suggest that alternative use of JAK-i, apart from tofacitinib alone, may be an effective treatment option for such patients.",

      "title": "P05\u2003The role of JAK inhibitors in difficult-to-treat adult-onset Still\u2019s disease: a case series",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Adult-onset Still\u2019s Disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic auto-inflammatory disorder characterised by fever, arthritis and rash. Some patients with AOSD exhibit resistance or intolerance to conventional treatments, necessitating alternative therapeutic strategies. This case series aims to explore the efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors in managing difficult-to-treat AOSD. The driving force behind Still\u2019s disease lies in the excessive and inappropriate production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, notably IL-6 and interferon. Given the pivotal role of JAK inhibitors in mitigating these cytokine pathways, this study highlights their potential therapeutic impact in the management of difficult to treat AOSD. Case description In this retrospective case series, three adult patients with difficult-to-treat AOSD were evaluated for their response to JAK inhibitors, specifically tofacitinib and baricitinib. Case 1: A 32-year-old male presented with a three-week history of fevers, night sweats, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. Diagnosed with AOSD 18 months later, his treatment began with prednisolone and methotrexate, which was subsequently switched to azathioprine. Tocilizumab was then introduced, alleviating joint pain but causing dermatitis. He was switched to anakinra, allowing a reduction in prednisolone but failing to induce remission and resulting in abnormal liver functions and increased hepatitis B virus titers. Finally, he commenced tofacitinib, achieving symptom resolution, reduced serum ferritin levels, and cessation of steroids. Case 2: A 32-year-old woman presented with a six-month history of joint pain, swelling, stiffness, night sweats, weight loss, and a recurrent rash. Laboratory tests showed anemia, lymphopenia, elevated inflammatory markers, and high ferritin levels. Initial treatment with 60\u2009mg oral prednisolone showed some response, but polyarthritis necessitated further intervention. Anakinra initially managed systemic symptoms, though joint swelling persisted. Tocilizumab was tried but proved ineffective. Subsequently, transitioning to baricitinib at 4\u2009mg daily resulted in good symptomatic control. Case 3: An 18-year-old female presented with recurrent fevers, an intermittent macular rash, joint pains, diarrhoea and splenomegaly. Despite initial antibiotic treatment, persistent symptoms led to an AOSD diagnosis, prompting steroid therapy. Methotrexate failed to control symptoms and caused significant nausea, leading to a switch to tocilizumab. While anakinra initially resolved skin and joint symptoms, recurrent flares necessitated further changes. Azathioprine was trialed but discontinued due to side effects. Colchicine was tried next. Finally, tofacitinib was introduced, and one year later, she achieved significant progress, reducing prednisolone dosage to 5\u2009mg. Discussion The findings from this case series underscore the potential of JAK inhibitors, particularly tofacitinib and baricitinib, as effective treatments for refractory AOSD. In all three cases, patients showed substantial clinical improvement and were able to reduce or discontinue steroids. This suggests a promising role for JAK inhibitors in managing AOSD, especially given the disease\u2019s association with excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production, including IL-6 and IFN pathways. The transition to JAK inhibitors was often necessitated by inadequate responses or adverse effects from conventional therapies like methotrexate, azathioprine, and biologics such as tocilizumab and anakinra. The successful outcomes with JAK inhibitors highlight their ability to achieve disease control where other treatments failed, demonstrating their efficacy in reducing systemic inflammation and disease activity. Further research is warranted to establish optimal dosing, duration of therapy, and long-term safety profiles of JAK inhibitors in this patient population. These preliminary results are encouraging and suggest a new avenue for treating AOSD. Key learning points \u2022\u2003Efficacy of JAK inhibitors: JAK inhibitors, particularly tofacitinib and baricitinib, demonstrated substantial clinical improvement in patients with refractory AOSD. \u2022\u2003Steroid reduction: All three patients were able to reduce or discontinue steroid use, highlighting the potential of JAK inhibitors to minimise long-term steroid dependency. \u2022\u2003Management of refractory AOSD: JAK inhibitors provided effective disease control where conventional therapies such as methotrexate, azathioprine, and biologics like tocilizumab and anakinra were inadequate or resulted in adverse effects. \u2022\u2003Mechanism of action: The efficacy of JAK inhibitors may be attributed to their ability to block pro-inflammatory cytokine pathways, particularly IL-6 and IFN, which are crucial in AOSD pathogenesis. \u2022\u2003Safety profile: The treatment was well-tolerated, with significant symptomatic relief and no severe adverse events reported during the study period. \u2022\u2003Need for further research: There is a need for further prospective studies to determine the optimal dosing, duration of therapy, and long-term safety profiles of JAK inhibitors in AOSD patients. \u2022\u2003Personalised treatment approach: The study supports a personalised treatment approach, considering JAK inhibitors for patients with difficult-to-treat AOSD who do not respond adequately to conventional therapies.",

Four patients died during follow up; one due to neutropenic sepsis with a background of advanced malignancy, and three due to Covid\u201019.\u00a0RTX was prescribed for multiple off\u2010label dermatological indications, often for recalcitrant disease. Responses were good overall, with a reassuring safety profile. Three patients died of Covid\u201019; knowledge of the impact of RTX on the immune response and efficacy of vaccines is expanding and will continue to inform guidelines for RTX use in the post\u2010Covid era.",

      "title": "Safety and efficacy of off-label bulevirtide monotherapy in patients with HDV with decompensated Child-B cirrhosis\u2014A real-world case series",
      "abstract": "Background and Aims: Chronic hepatitis D is the most debilitating form of viral hepatitis frequently progressing to cirrhosis and subsequent decompensation. However, the HDV entry inhibitor bulevirtide is only approved for antiviral treatment of patients with compensated disease. We aimed for the analysis of real-world data on the off-label use of bulevirtide in the setting of decompensated liver cirrhosis. Approach and Results: We conducted a retrospective study in patients with HDV with decompensated liver disease at German, Austrian, and Italian centers. We included 19 patients (47% male, mean age: 51 years) with liver cirrhosis Child-Pugh B. The median MELD score was 12 (range 9\u201317) at treatment initiation. The median observation period was 41 weeks. Virologic response was achieved in 74% and normal alanine aminotransferase was observed in 74%. The combined response was achieved by 42%. The most relevant adverse events included self-limited alanine aminotransferase flares, an asymptomatic increase in bile acids, and the need for liver transplantation. Despite bile acid increases, adverse events were considered unrelated. Clinical and laboratory improvement from Child-Pugh B to A occurred in 47% (n = 9/19). Improvements in the amount of ascites were observed in 58% of the patients initially presenting with ascites (n = 7/12). Conclusions: This report on off-label bulevirtide treatment in patients with decompensated HDV cirrhosis shows similar virologic and biochemical response rates as observed in compensated liver disease. Significant improvements were observed in surrogates of hepatic function and portal hypertension. However, this improvement was not seen in all patients. Controlled trials are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of bulevirtide in decompensated HDV cirrhosis.",

      "title": "Use, access, and initial outcomes of off-label ivosidenib in patients with IDH1 mutant glioma.",
      "abstract": "Background\nIsocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is commonly mutated (mIDH) in gliomas, and this mutant enzyme produces the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). 2HG promotes gliomagenesis and is implicated in epileptogenesis. Ivosidenib (IVO), a small molecule oral mIDH1 inhibitor, is FDA-approved for mIDH1 newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Moreover, IVO has efficacy in clinical trials for recurrent mIDH1 gliomas. Given the lack of targeted treatments for gliomas, we initiated off-label IVO for mIDH glioma patients in October 2020.\n\n\nMethods\nRetrospectively, we sought to assess early outcomes in our patients and describe their experience on IVO from October 2020 through February 2022. Our objective was to report on the following variables of off-label use of IVO: radiographic response, seizure control, tolerability, and access to the medication. All patients initially received single-agent IVO dosed at 500 mg orally once daily.\n\n\nResults\nThe cohort age range was 21-74 years. Tumor types included astrocytoma (n = 14) and oligodendroglioma (n = 16), with most being grade 2 (n = 21). The best radiographic response in nonenhancing disease (n = 22) was 12 stable diseases, 5 minor responses, 3 partial responses, and 2 progressive diseases. Seizure frequency was stable to improved for most patients (70%, n = 21). IVO was well-tolerated, with the most common toxicities being diarrhea, elevated creatine kinase, and QTc interval prolongation. Most patients (66.7%, n = 20) received drugs via the patient assistance program, with insurance initially covering a third of patients and with ongoing use, later covering 60%.\n\n\nConclusions\nTargeted therapies like IVO are options for mIDH glioma patients and can provide positive oncologic and neurological outcomes.",
