      "abstract": "Background Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have substantial unmet medical need. Baricitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK)1 and 2 inhibitor that was shown to have therapeutic benefit in patients with SLE in a phase II clinical trial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the median change from baseline in conventional serologic biomarkers in subgroups and the overall population of baricitinib-treated patients with SLE, and the SLE Responder Index-4 (SRI-4) response by normalization of anti-dsDNA. Methods Data were assessed from the phase II trial I4V-MC-JAHH (NCT02708095). The median change from baseline in anti-dsDNA, IgG, and other conventional serologic markers was evaluated over time in patients who had elevated levels of markers at baseline, and in all patients for IgG. Median change from baseline for baricitinib treatments were compared with placebo. Among patients who were anti-dsDNA positive at baseline, SRI-4 responder rate was compared for those who stayed positive or achieved normal levels by week 24. Results Significant decreases of anti-dsDNA antibodies were observed in response to baricitinib 2 mg and 4 mg compared to placebo beginning at weeks 2 (baricitinib 2 mg = \u2212 14.3 IU/mL, placebo = 0.1 IU/mL) and 4 (baricitinib 4 mg = \u2212 17.9 IU/mL, placebo = 0.02 IU/mL), respectively, continuing through week 24 (baricitinib 2 mg = \u2212 29.6 IU/mL, baricitinib 4 mg = \u2212 15.1 IU/mL, placebo=3.0 IU/mL). Significant reductions from baseline of IgG levels were found for baricitinib 4 mg-treated patients compared to placebo at weeks 12 (baricitinib 4 mg = \u2212 0.65 g/L, placebo = 0.09 g/L) and 24 (baricitinib 4 mg = \u2212 0.60 g/L, placebo = \u2212 0.04 g/L). For patients who were anti-dsDNA positive at baseline, no relationship between achieving SRI-4 responder and normalization of anti-dsDNA was observed by week 24. Conclusions Baricitinib treatment resulted in a rapid and sustained significant decrease in anti-dsDNA antibodies compared to placebo among those with positive anti-dsDNA antibodies at baseline, as well as a significant decrease in IgG levels in the 4 mg group at weeks 12 and 24. These data suggest that baricitinib may influence B cell activity in SLE. Further studies are needed to evaluate if reductions in anti-dsDNA levels with baricitinib treatment reflect the impact of baricitinib on B cell activity. Trial registration NCT02708095 .",

Baricitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor that interrupts the signaling pathway of IFN-\u03b3, a cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of LP.METHODSIn this phase II trial, 12 patients with cutaneous LP received 2 mg daily baricitinib for 16 weeks, accompanied by in-depth spatial, single-cell, and bulk transcriptomic profiling of pre- and posttreatment samples.RESULTSAn early and sustained clinical response was seen, with 83.3% of patients responsive at week 16. Our molecular data identified a unique, oligoclonal IFN-\u03b3, CD8+, and CXCL13+ cytotoxic T cell population in LP skin and demonstrated a rapid decrease in IFN signature within 2 weeks of treatment, most prominently in the basal layer of the epidermis.CONCLUSIONThis study demonstrates the efficacy and molecular mechanisms of JAK inhibition in LP.TRIAL REGISTRATIONNCT05188521FUNDINGEli Lilly, Appignani Benefactor Funds, 5P30AR075043, Mayo Clinic Clinical Trials Stimulus Funds.",

Some evidence of the clinical efficacy of JAKi in GCA exists and a phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) of upadacitinib is currently recruiting. In 2017, we started using barcitinib in a GCA patient with inadequate response to corticosteroids, and later on, we treated other 14 GCA patients with baricitinib/tofacitinib during intense follow-up. The retrospective data of these 15 individuals are here summarized. GCA was diagnosed based on the ACR criteria and/or imaging techniques combined with increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) followed by a good initial response to corticosteroids. JAKi was initiated based on inflammatory activity, with increased CRP, presumably dependent on GCA with clinical symptoms, despite unsatisfying high doses of prednisolone. The mean age at JAKi initiation was 70.1 years and the mean exposure to JAKi was 19 months. From initiation, significant reductions in CRP were seen already at 3 (",

      "abstract": "In recent years, several new systemic agents (biologics and Janus kinase inhibitors [JAKi]) have been registered for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). However, comparisons of real-world drug survival data and insights into treatment patterns of these advanced systemics are limited. Data from a prospective observational single-centre registry were collected from 549 adult AD patients (759 treatment courses) receiving biologics (dupilumab, tralokinumab) or JAKi (abrocitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib) and analysed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate predictors of survival. Frequencies and percentages summarized data on the initial and subsequent treatments received, with a Sankey diagram illustrating the switching patterns. The 18-month overall drug survival rates for dupilumab, abrocitinib, upadacitinib, tralokinumab, and baricitinib were 70.0%, 51.5%, 48.4%, 39.4%, and 20.4%, respectively. No significant predictors for drug survival were identified. Dupilumab was the predominant initial treatment (87.2%) and upadacitinib the most frequently used second and third treatment. In the total cohort, 57.9% of patients remained on their initial treatment and 26.8% switched to other treatments. In conclusion, dupilumab showed superior survival rates while baricitinib had the lowest survival rate. Frequent switching highlights the need for biomarkers that predict response to advanced systemic treatments to improve attrition rates.",

      "abstract": "Dysregulation of Janus kinase (JAK) pathways from uncontrolled cytokine signaling comprises the pathological basis for many complex inflammatory cutaneous disorders. Oral JAK inhibitors, upadacitinib, tofacitinib, and baricitinib targeting JAK 1 and JAK 1/3, respectively, are currently US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for several rheumatic conditions. However, studies have shown that JAK-mediated signaling pathways are involved in many immune-related dermatologic conditions. As a result, for recalcitrant diseases, JAK inhibitors are potential alternative therapies due to their broad targeted inhibitory mechanisms. In this case series, we present the successful off-label treatment of 6 cases across dermatomyositis, hidradenitis suppurativa, cutaneous lupus, and cutaneous Crohn&rsquo;s disease, which failed conventional therapies with upadacitinib or tofacitinib. In the 3 dermatomyositis cases, use of upadacitinib or tofacitinib demonstrated positive clinical outcomes, with no recurrent symptoms in cases where upadacitinib was used. In treatment-resistant hidradenitis suppurativa, upadacitinib demonstrated reduced systemic flares and moderate cutaneous symptom improvement. In the case of cutaneous Crohn&rsquo;s disease, upadacitinib resulted in reduced cutaneous symptoms without new flares. Tofacitinib resulted in completed resolution of cutaneous symptoms in our patient&rsquo;s case of cutaneous lupus erythematosus. JAK inhibitors upadacitinib and tofacitinib may be potential drug candidates in patients with treatment-resistant disease, especially in cases of inflammatory cutaneous conditions such as dermatomyositis, hidradenitis suppurativa, cutaneous lupus, and cutaneous Crohn&rsquo;s disease. Further studies with larger sample sizes among these conditions are warranted to assess potential broader applicability of the positive results demonstrated in our patient cases.

      "abstract": "As an inflammatory disease with a disrupted immune system, cytokine disorders in atopic dermatitis (AD) are closely related to the abnormal activation of JAK-STAT signal pathway. The critical relevance of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway to the pathogenesis of AD provides a strong rationale for JAK inhibitor research. Baricitinib, a small-molecule oral JAK inhibitor, has been proven to inhibit JAK-STAT signaling in a variety of diseases, including AD. It is currently available in China for off-label use. However, its efficacy in China and its mechanism are rarely reported. In our study, we found that the immune status of patients with moderate and severe AD was hyperactive. Among the 49 known immunotherapy targets, JAK1 and JAK2 genes on lymphocytes of AD patients were significantly upregulated, which was closely related to the symptom severity in moderate and severe AD patients. Baricitinib can improve immune hyperresponsiveness and clinical symptoms in moderate and severe AD by inhibiting the activation of Th2 cell subsets and the secretion of Th2-type cytokines through MAPK, mTOR and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, providing an important theoretical basis for clinical off-label use of Baricitinib to treat moderate and severe AD.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Appropriate recommendations for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) should be carefully followed. A significant adverse effect can develop unexpectedly, and off-label drug use may control this adverse effect and other lupus manifestations. The current research in lupus relies solely on multiple composite outcome measures, which vary from one study to another. However, the optimal drug for a particular lupus symptom is presently unclear, requiring additional research for definitive clarification. CASE REPORT Here, we report a typical case of SLE in a 54-year-old Saudi female patient who presented with mucocutaneous symptoms and arthritis. She had a positive serology for antinuclear antibodies and anti-double-stranded DNA. Owing to the failure of conventional drugs, the use of belimumab resulted in significant improvements. She later developed worsening symptoms that progressed from alopecia areata (AA) to alopecia totalis (AT) and alopecia universalis (AU). She partially responded to systemic and local steroid injections. All measures to taper her steroid failed despite the use of azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate. Belimumab was stopped due to lack of efficacy. She was re-challenged with belimumab after she showed partial response to steroid therapy, but this clearly resulted in worsening of her hair loss to AT. The use of baricitinib following the second discontinuation of belimumab resulted in a significant improvement in AT and arthritis. CONCLUSIONS Our case offers valuable perspectives for future SLE research by concentrating on specific outcomes instead of composite outcome measures. The effectiveness of baricitinib should be investigated further in SLE.",

      "abstract": "Population pharmacokinetic (popPK) modeling was used to characterize the PK profile of the oral Janus kinase (JAK)1/JAK2 inhibitor, baricitinib, in 18 patients with Mendelian interferonopathies who are enrolled in a compassionate use program. Patients received doses between 0.1 to 17\u2009mg per day. Covariates of weight and renal function significantly influenced volume-of-distribution and clearance, respectively. The half-life of baricitinib in patients less than 40\u2009kg was substantially shorter than in adult populations, requiring the need for dosing up to 4 times daily. On therapeutic doses, the mean area-under-the-concentration-vs.-time curve was 2,388\u2009nM*hr, which is 1.83-fold higher than mean baricitinib exposures in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving doses of 4\u2009mg once-daily. Dose-dependent decreases in interferon (IFN) biomarkers confirmed an in vivo effect of baricitinib on type-1 IFN signaling. PopPK and pharmacodynamic data support a proposal for a weight- and estimated glomerular filtration rate-based dosing regimen in guiding baricitinib dosing in patients with rare interferonopathies.",

      "abstract": "Real-world data on the drug survival of established and emerging treatment options in atopic dermatitis provide a comprehensive measure of the efficacy and tolerability of these interventions, which may enable improvements in clinical management. This study aimed to describe the drug survival, with associated predictors, of treatment with abrocitinib, baricitinib, cyclosporine, dupilumab, methotrexate, tralokinumab, and upadacitinib among patients with atopic dermatitis in Sweden who were recruited into the multicentre prospective SwedAD cohort between January 2017 and April 2024. A total of 1,194 patients were included with a total of 1,486 treatment episodes. The 2-year drug survival probability was 14.2% for baricitinib (treatment episodes, n\u2009=\u200930), 12.2% for cyclosporine (n\u2009=\u200940), 79.7% for dupilumab (n\u2009=\u20091,026), 45.4% for methotrexate (n\u2009=\u2009260), and 46.0% for upadacitinib (n\u2009=\u200989). Two-year follow-up data were not available for abrocitinib (n\u2009=\u200923) or tralokinumab (n\u2009=\u200918). All drugs were compared with the most used conventional systemic treatment at study baseline, methotrexate, using Cox regression. Only dupilumab showed a significantly lower hazard rate of drug discontinuation. In conclusion, dupilumab therapy demonstrated longer drug survival than methotrexate in atopic dermatitis. The impact of national treatment guidelines and time since drug approval should be considered when interpreting the results.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome, a rare immune-mediated inflammatory disease, poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges owing to its multi-system involvement, high heterogeneity, and lack of specific laboratory tests. Additionally, lacking evidence-based treatment recommendations, with the primary approach focusing on symptomatic relief. Herein, we report the case of a 32-year-old Chinese woman who presented with recurrent, generalized multiple osteoarticular pain lasting over one year and skin erythema pustulosis for 11 months. Traditional treatments, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and other traditional approaches, yielded no significant effects. Despite the prior use of adalimumab and acitretin capsules, the treatment remained unsatisfying, especially regarding the skin lesions. Considering the complex pathogenesis of SAPHO syndrome, the patient was orally administered baricitinib (2 mg), a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, twice daily. A notable improvement in both skin lesions and osteoarticular pain was observed within two weeks of treatment initiation. Subsequently, the dosage of baricitinib was halved and continued for an additional three months, during which regular follow-ups revealed neither disease recurrence nor adverse effects. Collectively, the successful treatment of refractory SAPHO syndrome with baricitinib presents a promising implication for addressing the therapeutic challenges of this rare autoimmune condition, offering a potential breakthrough in managing its complex manifestations.",

      "title": "Efficacy of Baricitinib in Patients with Refractory Adult-Onset Still\u2019s Disease",
      "abstract": "Background and Objective Adult-onset Still\u2019s disease (AOSD) is an idiopathic systemic inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology. Some patients exhibit resistance to conventional treatment during long-term therapy. Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKinibs) may contribute to the improvement in AOSD symptoms via the JAK\u2013signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. We aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in patients with refractory AOSD. Methods Patients were enrolled if they fulfilled the Yamaguchi AOSD classification criteria in China between 2020 and 2022. All patients were recognized as having refractory AOSD and were treated with oral baricitinib at a dosage of 4\u00a0mg once daily. A systemic score and prednisone dosage were used to evaluate the efficacy of baricitinib at months 1, 3, and 6 and at the last follow-up visit. The safety profiles were recorded and analysed at every assessment. Results Seven female patients with refractory AOSD received baricitinib. The median age was 31 (IQR 10) years. Treatment was terminated in one patient due to progressive macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Others continued baricitinib treatment until the last assessment. The systemic score decreased significantly at 3 months ( p \u00a0=\u00a00 . 0216), 6 months ( p \u00a0=\u00a00.0007), and the last follow-up visit ( p \u00a0=\u00a00.0007) compared with baseline. One month after the initiation of baricitinib, the rates of improvement in fever, rash, sore throat, and myalgia symptoms were 71.4% (5/7), 40% (2/5), 80% (4/5), and 66.7% (2/3), respectively. Five patients remained symptom-free at the last follow-up visit. In most patients, their laboratory values had returned to normal by the last follow-up visit. A significant reduction in the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) ( p \u00a0=\u00a00.0165) and ferritin ( p \u00a0=\u00a00.0047) was observed at the last visit compared with baseline. The daily prednisolone dosage significantly decreased from 35.7\u00a0\u00b1 15.1\u00a0mg/day at baseline to 8.8\u00a0\u00b1 4.4\u00a0mg/day by month 6 ( p \u00a0=\u00a00.0256), and it was 5.8\u00a0\u00b1 4.7\u00a0mg/day at the last assessment ( p \u00a0=\u00a00.0030). Leukopenia due to MAS was noted in one patient. Except for mild abnormalities in lipid parameters, no other severe adverse events occurred during follow-up. Conclusions Our findings suggest that baricitinib therapy could provide rapid and durable clinical and laboratory improvement in patients with refractory AOSD. Treatment seemed to be well tolerated by these patients. The long-term efficacy and safety of baricitinib therapy for AOSD should be assessed further in prospective controlled clinical trials in the future.

      "abstract": "Background Livedoid vasculopathy is a rare, chronic, and recurrent disease with limited effective treatments. Its etiopathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Baricitinib, a selective Janus kinase 1 and 2 inhibitor, has been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and could reduce the disease severity in patients with livedoid vasculopathy. Methods We retrospectively observed eight patients who received 2 mg/day of baricitinib for the treatment of refractory livedoid vasculopathy. We evaluated their clinical scores before and after treatment to determine its effectiveness and safety. Results Improvement in livedoid vasculopathy was observed with significant regression in the clinical scores after baricitinib treatment. The mean clinical scores were 7.0 \u00b1 1.6 and 1.4 \u00b1 1.2 before and after baricitinib treatment, respectively (P <0.01). Furthermore, six out of the eight patients achieved a clinical score of 0 or 2 after treatment. These scores indicated remission. Clinical findings, including erythema, ulceration, and pain, improved in all the patients. The remission times ranged from 3 to 13 weeks, with a mean remission time of 7.75 \u00b1 3.45 weeks. There were no reports of adverse events in any patient. Conclusions Our study showed that baricitinib treatment was safe and could significantly relieve the signs and symptoms of livedoid vasculopathy. However, randomized controlled studies should be conducted to confirm these results.",

      "abstract": "Blau syndrome (BS) is an autoinflammatory disorder characterized by non-caseating granulomatous dermatitis, arthritis, and uveitis. We present a case of refractory and severe BS that was treated with the Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKINIBS), Tofacitinib (TOFA) and then Baricitinib (BARI). Our aim was to describe the clinical and immunological outcomes after treatment with JAKINIBS. Blood tests and serum samples were obtained during follow-up with TOFA and BARI. We assessed their effects on clinical outcomes, acute phase reactants, absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs), lymphocyte subset counts, immunoglobulins, and cytokine levels. A review of the literature on the use of JAKINIBS for the treatment of uveitis and sarcoidosis was also conducted. TOFA led to a rapid and maintained disease control and a steroid-sparing effect. A decrease from baseline was observed in ALC, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and natural killer (NK) cell counts. B-cells were stable. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-4 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) increased, whereas IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 maintained stable. TOFA was discontinued after 19\u2009months due to significant lymphopenia. The initiation of BARI allowed maintaining adequate control of disease activity with an adequate safety profile. The literature review showed seven patients with uveitis and five with sarcoidosis treated with JAKINIBS. No cases of BS treated with JAKINIBS were found. We report the successful use of JAKINIBS in a patient with refractory and severe BS.",
