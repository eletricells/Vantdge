Extract FDA-approved BRANDED INNOVATIVE treatments for {{ disease }}.

=== CRITICAL: INDICATION-SPECIFIC FDA APPROVALS ONLY ===
Only count drugs with FDA approval for THIS EXACT INDICATION: "{{ disease }}"

{% if parent_disease %}
NOTE: "{{ disease }}" is a specific subtype/manifestation. Also consider approvals for the parent indication "{{ parent_disease }}" but clearly note if approval is for parent vs specific subtype.
{% endif %}

IMPORTANT INDICATION DISTINCTIONS (different FDA labels):
- "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)" ≠ "Lupus Nephritis" (different indications!)
  * SLE approved: Benlysta, Saphnelo
  * Lupus Nephritis approved: Lupkynis, Benlysta
- "Rheumatoid Arthritis" ≠ "Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis"
- "Atopic Dermatitis" (adult) may have different approvals than pediatric
- "Crohn's Disease" ≠ "Ulcerative Colitis"
- "Dermatomyositis" ≠ "Polymyositis" (though often overlap)
- "Uveitis" approvals may specify infectious vs non-infectious

If analyzing "{{ disease }}", only count drugs FDA-approved for EXACTLY "{{ disease }}".
Do NOT count drugs approved for related but different indications.

=== APPROVAL CONFIDENCE SCORING ===
- High: FDA press release, Drugs@FDA database, or drug label confirms approval for THIS indication
- Medium: Reputable source (UpToDate, Medscape) states FDA approved, but exact label not verified
- Low: Only mentions "approved" without specifying FDA vs EMA vs other, or approval status unclear

=== COMMON FALSE POSITIVES TO AVOID ===
- "Approved for [related disease]" ≠ approved for THIS disease
- "Recommended in guidelines" ≠ FDA approved
- "Used in clinical practice" or "Standard of care" ≠ FDA approved
- "EMA approved" ≠ FDA approved (different regulatory agencies)
- "Approved in Japan/China" ≠ FDA approved

=== VALIDATION RULES ===
1. fda_approved=true ONLY if FDA approved for EXACTLY "{{ disease }}" (not related conditions)
2. approved_drug_names MUST only contain drugs where is_branded_innovative=true AND fda_approved=true for THIS indication
3. num_approved_drugs MUST exactly equal length of approved_drug_names list
4. Generic drugs (corticosteroids, methotrexate, etc.) should NEVER appear in approved_drug_names
5. If drug is approved for related but different indication (e.g., Lupus Nephritis vs SLE), set fda_approved=false
6. If unsure about approval status, set fda_approved=false and approval_confidence="Low"
