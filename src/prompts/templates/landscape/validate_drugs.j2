Guidelines:
- If sponsor is a university, hospital, or individual researcher → Investigator
- If sponsor is a pharmaceutical/biotech company → Industry
- If trials are all "Terminated", "Withdrawn", "Suspended" → Discontinued
- If trials are "Completed" with no recent activity (>2 years) → Completed
- If trials are "Recruiting", "Active", "Enrolling" → Active
- Standard care drugs in investigator trials are likely testing existing drugs → Investigator
