Extract ALL baseline characteristics for trial arm: {{ arm_name }}

TABLES TO ANALYZE: {{ tables | join(', ') }}

BASELINE TABLES:
{{ table_content }}

🚨 CRITICAL: YOU ARE EXTRACTING FOR "{{ arm_name }}" (N={{ n }})

{% include 'clinical_extraction/_partials/column_identification.j2' %}

1. EXTRACT FROM BOTH TABLES AND TEXT:
   - Primary source: Baseline/demographics tables (usually Table 1)
   - Secondary source: Text in Results section describing baseline characteristics
   - Extract EVERY characteristic mentioned, whether in tables or text
   - If a characteristic appears in both table and text, prefer the table value
   - Do NOT skip any characteristics, even if they seem minor

2. EXTRACT EVERYTHING FROM THE BASELINE TABLES:
   - Your task is to extract EVERY SINGLE ROW from the baseline/demographics tables
   - Do NOT skip any rows, even if they seem minor or unimportant
   - Do NOT filter based on what you think is relevant
   - Extract the data EXACTLY as shown in the tables

3. HIERARCHICAL/NESTED CHARACTERISTICS - CRITICAL:
   - Many tables have parent rows with subcategories underneath (indented or nested)
   - Extract EACH subcategory as a SEPARATE entry
   - DO NOT extract just the parent row - you MUST extract ALL child rows

   EXAMPLE from a typical baseline table:
   ```
   | Race, n (%)           |       |  ← Parent row (DO NOT extract this alone)
   |   Asian               | 14    |  ← Extract this as "Race - Asian"
   |   Black               | 4     |  ← Extract this as "Race - Black"
   |   White               | 45    |  ← Extract this as "Race - White"
   | Glucocorticoid use    | 52    |  ← Parent row (DO NOT extract this alone)
   |   ≤10 mg/d            | 40    |  ← Extract this as "Glucocorticoid use - ≤10 mg/d"
   |   >10 mg/d            | 12    |  ← Extract this as "Glucocorticoid use - >10 mg/d"
   ```

   - Common patterns:
     * Race/Ethnicity with subcategories → Extract each race separately
     * Medication use with dose categories → Extract each dose category separately
     * Disease severity with score ranges → Extract each range separately
     * Organ/system involvement with specific organs → Extract each organ separately
     * Lab values with normal/abnormal ranges → Extract each range separately
   - DO NOT skip subcategories or nested rows
   - DO NOT summarize multiple subcategories into one entry
   - If you see indentation or sub-bullets in a table, those are subcategories

4. NUMERIC FIELDS:
   - For ALL numeric fields (mean_value, median_value, sd_value, percentage, etc.), return NULL if value is missing
   - DO NOT return text like "Not reported", "Not explicitly stated", "Not available"
   - ONLY return actual numeric values or NULL

5. CATEGORIZATION:
   - Assign each characteristic to ONE of these categories:
     * "Demographics" - Age, sex, race, weight, BMI, blood pressure, geographic region, etc.
     * "Disease Biomarkers" - Lab values, biomarkers, antibody status, proteinuria, complement levels, etc.
     * "Severity Scores" - Disease severity scores, activity indices, functional scores, etc.
     * "Prior Medications" - Medication use, treatment history, concomitant medications, etc.
   - When in doubt, use "Disease Biomarkers"

6. NAMING CONVENTION:
   - For parent characteristics with subcategories, use format: "Parent - Subcategory"
   - Examples:
     * "Race - Asian", "Race - Black", "Race - White"
     * "Medication dose - ≤10 mg/day", "Medication dose - >10 mg/day"
     * "Disease severity - Mild", "Disease severity - Moderate", "Disease severity - Severe"
   - For standalone characteristics, use the exact name from the table
   - Preserve the original terminology from the paper (don't rename or standardize)

For EACH characteristic found:
- characteristic_name: Clear name (e.g., "Age", "Race - Asian", "Disease duration")
- characteristic_category: One of "Demographics", "Disease Biomarkers", "Severity Scores", "Prior Medications"
- value_numeric: The numeric value (if applicable)
- value_text: The categorical value (if applicable)
- unit: Unit of measurement (e.g., "years", "kg", "mg/dL", "%")
- n_patients: Number of patients (if applicable)
- percentage: Percentage (if applicable)
- mean_value: Mean (if applicable)
- median_value: Median (if applicable)
- sd_value: Standard deviation (if applicable)
- range_min: Minimum value (if applicable)
- range_max: Maximum value (if applicable)
- cohort: Cohort name if study has subgroups (e.g., "Overall", "Subgroup A")
- source_table: Which table this came from (e.g., "Table 1")
