TASK: Extract comprehensive trial design information.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Study Design: Extract the study design classification
   - Example: "Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trial"

2. Trial Design Summary: Write a 2-3 sentence narrative summarizing:
   - Study design and objectives
   - Randomization approach
   - Blinding
   - Duration

3. Enrollment Summary: Describe the enrolled patient population (2-3 sentences)
   - Key demographic characteristics
   - Disease severity requirements
   - Treatment history requirements

4. Inclusion Criteria: Extract as list of strings

5. Exclusion Criteria: Extract as list of strings

6. Primary Endpoint: Extract description of primary endpoint

7. Secondary Endpoints: Summarize secondary endpoints

8. Trial Parameters (extract exact numbers when available)
