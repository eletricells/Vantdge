Analyze the clinical trial paper for {{ nct_id }} ({{ indication }}).

TASK: Identify where baseline, efficacy, and safety data are located in the paper.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Scan the paper for tables and figures containing:
   - Baseline characteristics (demographics, prior medications, disease severity)
   - Efficacy endpoints (primary, secondary outcomes at various timepoints)
   - Safety endpoints (adverse events, serious adverse events)

🚨 CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - PREVENTING HALLUCINATIONS:

STEP 1: Read the paper carefully to identify which arms were DISCONTINUED or STOPPED EARLY
- Look for phrases like "discontinued after interim analysis", "stopped early", "terminated"
- Look for phrases like "data in Supplementary Table X" or "data not shown"
- These arms should be COMPLETELY EXCLUDED from extraction

STEP 2: For each arm mentioned in the paper, verify it has data in the MAIN tables
- Check if the arm appears as a COLUMN in Table 1 (baseline characteristics)
- Check if the arm appears in Table 2, Table 3, etc. (efficacy/safety results)
- If an arm is only mentioned in text but NOT in any main table columns, EXCLUDE it

STEP 3: Use OFFICIAL ARM NAMES from the paper, not dosing descriptions
- If paper says "ABBV-599 high dose (elsubrutinib 60 mg + upadacitinib 30 mg)", use "ABBV-599 high dose"
- If paper says "Drug A 300mg", use "Drug A 300mg" (not just "Drug A")
- Use the name that appears in table headers and figure legends

STEP 4: When in doubt, EXCLUDE the arm
- It is better to miss a discontinued arm than to fabricate data for it
- If you cannot find baseline data for an arm in Table 1, DO NOT include it
- If an arm is described as discontinued, DO NOT include it even if you see some data

Example 1: If paper says "elsubrutinib arm was discontinued after interim analysis,
baseline data in Supplementary Table 1" and Table 1 only has columns for ABBV-599, Upadacitinib, and Placebo,
DO NOT include elsubrutinib in trial_arms list. Add to notes: "Excluded discontinued arms: elsubrutinib 60mg"

Example 2: If paper says "ABBV-599 high dose (elsubrutinib 60 mg and upadacitinib 30 mg once daily)",
use arm_name: "ABBV-599 high dose", dosing_regimen: "elsubrutinib 60 mg and upadacitinib 30 mg once daily"

2. Identify all trial arms/treatment groups WITH DATA IN MAIN TABLES:
   - For RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS: Identify all ACTIVE arms with data (e.g., Drug, Placebo, Active Comparator)
   - For SINGLE-ARM STUDIES: Identify the one treatment arm (often just the drug being tested)
   - For DOSE-RANGING STUDIES: Identify each dose level as a separate arm

   IMPORTANT: Single-arm studies have only ONE treatment group (no placebo/comparator).
   These are common in early-phase trials. You MUST still identify and return this arm!

3. Extract sample size (n) for each arm from the Methods or Results sections

4. Output JSON with exact table/figure references

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "baseline_tables": ["Table 1", "Table 2"],
  "efficacy_tables": ["Table 3", "Figure 2"],
  "safety_tables": ["Table 4"],
  "trial_arms": [
    {
      "arm_name": "Treatment" or "Pegcetacoplan 360mg" or "Placebo",
      "dosing_regimen": "360 mg SC daily" or null,
      "background_therapy": "Standard of care" or null,
      "n": 224
    }
  ],
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "notes": "Single-arm study" or "Randomized controlled trial" or "Excluded discontinued arms: elsubrutinib 60mg, ABBV-599 low dose"
}

EXAMPLES OF TRIAL ARM IDENTIFICATION:

Single-arm study:
- If paper says "8 patients received pegcetacoplan 360 mg daily"
- Return: {"arm_name": "Pegcetacoplan 360mg", "dosing_regimen": "360 mg SC daily", "n": 8}

Randomized controlled trial:
- If paper says "224 patients randomized to drug (n=112) or placebo (n=112)"
- Return two arms: {"arm_name": "Drug", "n": 112} and {"arm_name": "Placebo", "n": 112}

Discontinued arms (DO NOT INCLUDE):
- If paper says "elsubrutinib arm discontinued after interim analysis, baseline data in Supplementary Table 1"
- And you only have Table 1 (not Supplementary Table 1)
- DO NOT include elsubrutinib in trial_arms
- Add to notes: "Excluded discontinued arms: elsubrutinib 60mg"
