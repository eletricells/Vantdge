🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL WARNING - EVENT RATE DATA 🚨🚨🚨

BEFORE YOU START: Check if any endpoints measure EVENT RATES (not % of patients):
- Flares, Infections, Exacerbations, Adverse Events per patient-year
- These show a RATE (e.g., "1.7 flares per patient-year") and sometimes an event count

FOR EVENT RATE DATA:
✓ Extract the RATE value (e.g., 1.7) → put in mean_value field
✓ Extract the unit (e.g., "events per patient-year") → put in endpoint_unit field
✓ IGNORE the event count (e.g., 51 events) - this is NOT a responder count!
✓ Set responders_n = NULL (event counts are NOT patient counts!)
✓ Set responders_pct = NULL

Example: "Overall Flares: 1.7 flares per patient-year (51 events/PY)"
→ mean_value: 1.7 (the RATE, not the event count!)
→ endpoint_unit: "events per patient-year"
→ responders_n: NULL (NOT 51! 51 is event count, not patient count)

🚨 KEY POINT: If you see "X.X per patient-year" and "YY events", use X.X (the rate), NOT YY!
