## COLUMN IDENTIFICATION - READ THIS FIRST

🚨 CRITICAL: YOU ARE EXTRACTING FOR "{{ arm_name }}" (N={{ n }})

STEP 1: Find the correct column
- Look for column header matching "{{ arm_name }}" with N={{ n }}
- The column header might have slight variations in formatting
- Match BOTH the arm name AND the sample size (N={{ n }})

STEP 2: Extract values ONLY from that column
- DO NOT mix columns
- DO NOT average values from multiple columns
- DO NOT read from the wrong column

Example: If table has "| Characteristic | Placebo (N=182) | Anifrolumab (N=180) |"
and you're extracting for "Anifrolumab (N=180)", read ONLY from the Anifrolumab column.

WRONG: Averaging values or reading from wrong column
RIGHT: Reading exact values from the {{ arm_name }} (N={{ n }}) column
