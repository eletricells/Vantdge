Extract ALL individual adverse events for {{ arm_name }} (N={{ n }}).

TABLES: {{ tables | join(', ') }}

SAFETY TABLES:
{{ table_content }}

🚨 CRITICAL COLUMN IDENTIFICATION 🚨
You are extracting data for: "{{ arm_name }}" with N={{ n }}

STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE CORRECT COLUMN
Look at the table header row. It will look like:
| Event | (N = 182) | (N = 180) |

The columns are:
- Column 1: Event names
- Column 2: First treatment arm (check the N value)
- Column 3: Second treatment arm (check the N value)

YOU MUST extract from the column where the header shows (N = {{ n }})

EXAMPLE - If you're extracting for "Placebo" with N=182:
Table header: | Event | (N = 182) | (N = 180) |
Data row:     | Herpes zoster | 2 (1.1) | 13 (7.2) |

✅ CORRECT: Extract "2" from column 2 because (N = 182) matches Placebo N=182
❌ WRONG: Do NOT extract "13" from column 3 - that's the other arm!

EXAMPLE - If you're extracting for "Anifrolumab" with N=180:
Table header: | Event | (N = 182) | (N = 180) |
Data row:     | Herpes zoster | 2 (1.1) | 13 (7.2) |

✅ CORRECT: Extract "13" from column 3 because (N = 180) matches Anifrolumab N=180
❌ WRONG: Do NOT extract "2" from column 2 - that's the other arm!

STEP 2: PARSE THE VALUES
Values are typically formatted as: "count (percentage%)"
Examples:
- "153 (84.1)" means n_patients=153, incidence_pct=84.1
- "2 (1.1)" means n_patients=2, incidence_pct=1.1
- "0" means n_patients=0, incidence_pct=0.0

STEP 3: EXTRACT EVERY SINGLE ROW
Extract ALL events from the table, including:
- Any adverse event
- Serious adverse event
- Death
- Adverse event leading to discontinuation
- ALL specific events listed (infections, musculoskeletal, respiratory, etc.)

DO NOT skip any rows. Extract EVERY event you see.

INSTRUCTIONS:
For EACH event row in the table:
- event_category: Categorize as "Any AE", "SAE", "AE leading to discontinuation", "Specific AE", "AE of special interest"
- event_name: Exact event name from first column
- n_patients: Number extracted from YOUR column (the one matching N={{ n }})
- incidence_pct: Percentage extracted from YOUR column
- cohort: "{{ arm_name }}"
- timepoint: "Overall" (unless table specifies otherwise)
- source_table: The table label (e.g., "Table 5")

CONCRETE EXAMPLE FOR YOUR EXTRACTION:
You are extracting for: {{ arm_name }} (N={{ n }})

If the table shows:
| Event | (N = 182) | (N = 180) |
|:------|:----------|:----------|
| Any adverse event | 153 (84.1) | 159 (88.3) |
| Herpes zoster | 2 (1.1) | 13 (7.2) |
| Bronchitis | 7 (3.8) | 22 (12.2) |

And you're extracting for the arm with N={{ n }}, you should extract from the column with header "(N = {{ n }})".

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "event_category": "Any AE",
      "event_name": "Any adverse event",
      "n_patients": <number from YOUR column>,
      "incidence_pct": <percentage from YOUR column>,
      "cohort": "{{ arm_name }}",
      "timepoint": "Overall",
      "source_table": "<table label>"
    },
    {
      "event_category": "Specific AE",
      "event_name": "Herpes zoster",
      "n_patients": <number from YOUR column>,
      "incidence_pct": <percentage from YOUR column>,
      "cohort": "{{ arm_name }}",
      "timepoint": "Overall",
      "source_table": "<table label>"
    }
  ]
}

🚨 REMEMBER: Extract from the column matching N={{ n }}, and extract EVERY SINGLE ROW.
