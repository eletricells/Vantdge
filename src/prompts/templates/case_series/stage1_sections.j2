Analyze this case report/series about {{ drug_name }} and identify the key data sections.

Identify:
1. Tables containing baseline/demographic data
2. Tables containing efficacy/outcome data
3. Tables containing safety/adverse event data
4. Figures showing clinical outcomes
5. Key results sections

COMMON TABLE/FIGURE PATTERNS TO LOOK FOR:

BASELINE/DEMOGRAPHICS (usually Table 1):
- Headers containing: "Baseline", "Demographics", "Characteristics", "Patient characteristics"
- Columns like: Age, Sex, Disease duration, Prior treatments, Baseline disease activity

EFFICACY TABLES (usually Table 2-3):
- Headers containing: "Efficacy", "Outcomes", "Response", "Results", "Clinical outcomes"
- Columns like: Baseline, Week X, Change, % Change, Responders
- Row labels with: Response rates, Disease scores (EASI, PASI, SLEDAI), Remission

SAFETY TABLES (often Table 3-4 or supplementary):
- Headers containing: "Safety", "Adverse Events", "AEs", "Tolerability"
- Columns like: n (%), Events, Related, Serious
- Row labels with: Any AE, Serious AE, Infections, specific event names

EFFICACY FIGURES:
- Kaplan-Meier curves (time to response, duration of response)
- Waterfall plots (individual patient responses)
- Spider plots (disease activity over time)
- Bar charts comparing response rates
- Line graphs showing score changes over time

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS:
- "Supplementary Table S1" often contains detailed AE data
- "Extended Data" may have individual patient data
- "Online supplement" may have additional efficacy endpoints

PATIENT COUNT EXTRACTION (CRITICAL - DO NOT RETURN NULL IF COUNT IS STATED):
Extract patient_count from ANY of these sources:

FROM ABSTRACT/INTRO:
- "10 patients with X were treated" → patient_count: 10
- "a series of 15 patients" → patient_count: 15
- "n=20 patients" or "N=20" → patient_count: 20
- "enrolled 25 patients" → patient_count: 25
- "a cohort of 30 patients" → patient_count: 30

FROM METHODS SECTION:
- "We included 12 consecutive patients"
- "Study population consisted of 8 patients"
- "Participants: 18 adults with..."

FROM TABLES:
- Look for "N" column headers or "Total" rows
- Baseline characteristics table typically states total N

FROM RESPONSE DENOMINATORS:
- "8/10 patients responded" → patient_count: 10
- "Response in 5 of 7 (71%)" → patient_count: 7

SINGLE PATIENT (case report):
- "A 45-year-old woman with X" → patient_count: 1
- "We report a case" → patient_count: 1
- "A patient with X" → patient_count: 1

NEVER return patient_count: null if ANY count is mentioned in the text.
