Identify:
1. Tables containing baseline/demographic data
2. Tables containing efficacy/outcome data
3. Tables containing safety/adverse event data
4. Figures showing clinical outcomes
5. Key results sections

COMMON TABLE/FIGURE PATTERNS TO LOOK FOR:

BASELINE/DEMOGRAPHICS (usually Table 1):
- Headers containing: "Baseline", "Demographics", "Characteristics", "Patient characteristics"
- Columns like: Age, Sex, Disease duration, Prior treatments, Baseline disease activity

EFFICACY TABLES (usually Table 2-3):
- Headers containing: "Efficacy", "Outcomes", "Response", "Results", "Clinical outcomes"
- Columns like: Baseline, Week X, Change, % Change, Responders
- Row labels with: Response rates, Disease scores (EASI, PASI, SLEDAI), Remission

SAFETY TABLES (often Table 3-4 or supplementary):
- Headers containing: "Safety", "Adverse Events", "AEs", "Tolerability"
- Columns like: n (%), Events, Related, Serious
- Row labels with: Any AE, Serious AE, Infections, specific event names

EFFICACY FIGURES:
- Kaplan-Meier curves (time to response, duration of response)
- Waterfall plots (individual patient responses)
- Spider plots (disease activity over time)
- Bar charts comparing response rates
- Line graphs showing score changes over time

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS:
- "Supplementary Table S1" often contains detailed AE data
- "Extended Data" may have individual patient data
- "Online supplement" may have additional efficacy endpoints
