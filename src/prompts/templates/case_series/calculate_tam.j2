=== TAM CALCULATION FRAMEWORK ===
TAM should account for REALISTIC market penetration, not total patient population x cost.

Consider:
1. TREATMENT FUNNEL:
   - What % of patients are diagnosed?
   - What % of diagnosed patients receive treatment?
   - What line of therapy would a new drug likely be positioned? (1L, 2L, 3L)
   - What % of patients reach each line of therapy?

2. MARKET PENETRATION:
   - How many approved competitors exist?
   - What market share could a new entrant realistically capture?
   - Typical new drug peak market share: 10-30% in crowded markets, 30-50% in underserved

3. TREATMENT DURATION:
   - Is this chronic or acute treatment?
   - What is typical treatment duration and compliance?

4. PRICING:
   - What is realistic pricing for this indication?
   - Orphan drugs: $100K-500K/yr, Specialty: $50K-150K/yr, Primary care: $10K-50K/yr

THERAPEUTIC AREA BENCHMARKS:

AUTOIMMUNE - DERMATOLOGY (Atopic Dermatitis, Psoriasis, Alopecia Areata):
- Pricing: $30-60K/year
- Market penetration: 60-80% of moderate-severe patients
- Treatment duration: Chronic, high compliance
- Reference launches:
  * Dupixent (AD): ~$37K/yr, achieved ~40% market share in moderate-severe
  * Rinvoq (AD): ~$60K/yr, capturing share with oral convenience
  * Skyrizi (Psoriasis): ~$60K/yr, rapid uptake with superior efficacy

AUTOIMMUNE - RHEUMATOLOGY (RA, PsA, axSpA):
- Pricing: $50-80K/year
- Market penetration: 50-70% of biologic-eligible patients
- Treatment duration: Chronic
- Reference launches:
  * Rinvoq (RA): ~$60K/yr, competing with established biologics
  * Taltz (PsA): ~$65K/yr

RARE AUTOIMMUNE (Dermatomyositis, Scleroderma, Vasculitis):
- Pricing: $80-200K/year (orphan eligible)
- Market penetration: 30-50% of diagnosed patients
- Lower diagnosis rates
- Reference: Specialty drugs in similar rare diseases

ULTRA-RARE (<5,000 US patients):
- Pricing: $200-500K/year
- Market penetration: 40-60% of diagnosed (strong unmet need)
- Orphan drug exclusivity benefits

LUPUS (SLE, Lupus Nephritis):
- Pricing: $40-80K/year
- Complex market with multiple lines of therapy
- Market penetration: 40-60%
- Reference launches:
  * Saphnelo (SLE): ~$60K/yr, slow uptake in crowded market
  * Lupkynis (LN): ~$75K/yr, narrow indication

TREATMENT FUNNEL DEFAULTS (if not specified):
- Diagnosis rate: 60-80% for common diseases, 30-50% for rare
- Treatment rate: 50-70% of diagnosed receive systemic treatment
- 2L reach: 25-40% of treated patients fail 1L
- 3L reach: 10-20% of treated patients fail 2L
- New drug peak share: 15-30% in crowded market, 30-50% in underserved

CALCULATION TEMPLATE:
TAM = (Patient population) × (Diagnosis rate) × (Treatment rate) × (Target LOT reach) × (Market share) × (Annual price)

Example for rare autoimmune (10,000 US patients):
= 10,000 × 0.70 × 0.60 × 0.35 × 0.30 × $100,000
= 10,000 × 0.0441 × $100,000 = $44.1M

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{
    "tam_usd": integer (Total Addressable Market in USD),
    "tam_estimate": "formatted string (e.g., '$2.5B')",
    "tam_rationale": "Detailed 2-4 sentence explanation including: patient funnel (X diagnosed, Y% treated, Z% reach target LOT), assumed market share (A%), pricing ($B/yr), calculation steps"
}

EXAMPLE tam_rationale:
"Of ~100,000 US patients with [disease], ~70% are diagnosed (70K), ~60% receive systemic treatment (42K), ~30% fail 1L therapy and are candidates for 2L+ (12.6K). A new 2L drug could capture 25-35% market share (~3.8K patients). At $75K/yr, TAM = $285M. High unmet need in refractory population supports premium pricing."
