Extract ALL safety data from this case report/series about {{ drug_name }}.

DRUG: {{ drug_name }}
IDENTIFIED SAFETY TABLES: {{ safety_tables }}

PAPER CONTENT:
{{ paper_content }}

Extract EVERY adverse event and safety outcome mentioned:
- Any adverse events (AEs)
- Serious adverse events (SAEs)
- Adverse events of special interest
- Laboratory abnormalities
- Treatment discontinuations
- Dose modifications

CRITICAL - HANDLING SAFETY DATA PRESENCE/ABSENCE:

1. IF PAPER EXPLICITLY STATES "NO ADVERSE EVENTS":
   - Phrases like "well-tolerated with no adverse events", "no AEs reported", "no safety concerns"
   - Set safety_data_reported: true
   - Set safety_events: [] (empty array, NOT null)
   - Add a summary note: "Paper explicitly states no adverse events occurred"

2. IF PAPER REPORTS SPECIFIC ADVERSE EVENTS:
   - Extract each AE as a separate entry
   - Set safety_data_reported: true
   - Populate safety_events array

3. IF PAPER DOES NOT MENTION SAFETY AT ALL:
   - Set safety_data_reported: false
   - Set safety_events: null (NOT empty array)
   - Note: "Safety outcomes not reported in this paper"

This distinction is critical for downstream analysis - "no AEs occurred" is very different from "AEs not reported".

For each safety event, extract:

SAFETY REPORTING QUALITY:
- Systematic: Structured AE collection with counts/percentages for multiple event types
- Mentioned: Some AEs mentioned but not systematically collected (e.g., "one patient developed herpes zoster")
- Not reported: Safety not discussed in the paper

Include ALL adverse events mentioned. For events affecting zero patients (if explicitly stated), still include with patients_affected_n: 0.
