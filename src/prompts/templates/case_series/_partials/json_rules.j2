CRITICAL JSON RULES - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

1. OUTPUT FORMAT:
   - Return ONLY valid JSON
   - No markdown code fences (```)
   - No explanatory text before or after the JSON
   - No comments within the JSON

2. NULL VALUES:
   - Use null for missing/unknown values
   - Do NOT use empty strings (""), "N/A", "unknown", or "not reported"
   - Example: "response_rate": null (NOT "response_rate": "")

3. DATA TYPES:
   - Numbers must be numbers: 5 (NOT "5")
   - Percentages as numbers: 80.0 (NOT "80%" or "80.0%")
   - Booleans as true/false: true (NOT "true" or "True")
   - Integers where specified: 15 (NOT 15.0)

4. STRING ESCAPING:
   - Escape quotes within strings: "He said \"hello\""
   - Escape backslashes: "path\\to\\file"
   - No unescaped newlines in string values

5. ARRAY FORMATTING:
   - No trailing commas: ["a", "b"] (NOT ["a", "b",])
   - Empty arrays as []: "adverse_events": []

6. EXTRACTION PRINCIPLES:
   - Extract only what is explicitly stated in the source data
   - If a value is not clearly stated, use null
   - Do not infer or calculate values unless specifically instructed
   - When uncertain between two values, prefer null over guessing

7. NULL VS EMPTY DISTINCTIONS (CRITICAL):
   Use null and empty values correctly to preserve information:

   - null = Data NOT AVAILABLE, NOT REPORTED, or UNKNOWN
     Example: "adverse_events": null means "AE data was not reported in this paper"

   - [] (empty array) = Data IS AVAILABLE and confirms ZERO items
     Example: "adverse_events": [] means "paper explicitly states no AEs occurred"

   - 0 = Data confirms zero count
     Example: "sae_count": 0 means "paper states zero SAEs"
     Example: "sae_count": null means "SAE count not reported"

   EXAMPLES:
   - Paper says "No adverse events were reported" → "adverse_events": [], "sae_count": 0
   - Paper doesn't mention safety at all → "adverse_events": null, "sae_count": null
   - Paper says "5 patients had no prior treatments" → "prior_treatments_failed": []
   - Paper doesn't mention prior treatments → "prior_treatments_failed": null

8. NUMERIC PRECISION:
   - Report percentages to one decimal place: 83.3 (NOT 83.333333)
   - Report p-values as strings when ranges: "<0.05", "<0.001"
   - Report exact p-values as numbers when given: 0.023
