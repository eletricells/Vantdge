APPROVED INDICATIONS TO EXCLUDE: {{ exclude_indications }}

For each paper, determine if it contains ORIGINAL CLINICAL DATA that would be useful for evaluating off-label efficacy.

For EACH paper, systematically evaluate these criteria:

INCLUSION CRITERIA (all must be YES to include):
1. PATIENT COUNT: Does it mention a specific number of patients treated?
   - YES: "n=5", "15 patients received", "a 42-year-old woman"
   - NO: "patients were treated", no specific count mentioned

2. CLINICAL OUTCOMES: Does it report efficacy/outcome data?
   - YES: Response rates, remission, improvement scores, disease activity changes
   - NO: Only describes treatment protocol, only pharmacokinetics

3. OFF-LABEL USE: Is this about a non-approved indication?
   - YES: Disease is NOT in the approved indications list
   - NO: Disease is an approved indication ({{ exclude_indications }})

4. ORIGINAL DATA: Is this original patient data (not a review)?
   - YES: Case report, case series, retrospective study, cohort study
   - NO: Review article, meta-analysis, guidelines, editorial

DECISION: Include ONLY if criteria 1-4 are ALL answered YES.

For each paper, provide your reasoning in the "reason" field, referencing which criteria were met or failed.

INCLUDE papers that have ALL of the above:
- Case reports or case series with patient outcomes
- Retrospective observational studies with efficacy data
- Prospective cohort studies with treatment outcomes
- Compassionate use / expanded access reports with results
- Real-world evidence with response rates
- Studies labeled "experience with" or "treated with" that report outcomes
- Single-center or multi-center case series
- **INVESTIGATOR-SPONSORED RCTs** - Academic/independent randomized trials conducted by researchers at universities or medical centers (NOT funded by drug manufacturer)
- **Pilot studies or feasibility trials** from academic institutions

EXCLUDE these paper types (even if they have patient data):
- **MANUFACTURER-SPONSORED RCTs** - Industry-funded trials, especially those with formal trial names (e.g., BEACON, BREVITY, RA-BEAM, etc.)
- **Pivotal trials or registration trials** - Studies designed for regulatory approval (FDA/EMA submission)
- **Phase 2b or Phase 3 trials with commercial sponsors** - Large-scale trials funded by pharmaceutical companies
- **Industry-funded post-marketing studies** - Phase 4 trials sponsored by manufacturers
- Reviews, guidelines, consensus statements, position papers
- Basic science / mechanistic studies without patients treated
- Pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics studies without clinical efficacy
- Drug monitoring / analytical method papers
- Studies ONLY about approved indications: {{ exclude_indications }}
- Safety-only studies without efficacy outcomes
- Clinical trial protocols (not results)
- Letters/editorials without original patient data
- In vitro or animal studies only

KEY DISTINCTION: We want to INCLUDE investigator-initiated/academic research (even if randomized) but EXCLUDE manufacturer-sponsored commercial trials.
Signs of manufacturer-sponsored trials: formal trial acronyms (all caps names like BEACON, BREVITY), "sponsored by [pharma company]", large Phase 3 sample sizes (>200 patients), multiple international sites.
Signs of investigator-sponsored trials: single academic center, "investigator-initiated", smaller sample sizes, no formal trial name, funded by grants/foundations.
