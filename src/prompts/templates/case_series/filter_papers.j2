APPROVED INDICATIONS TO EXCLUDE: {{ exclude_indications }}

For each paper, determine if it contains ORIGINAL CLINICAL DATA that would be useful for evaluating off-label efficacy.

For EACH paper, systematically evaluate these criteria:

INCLUSION CRITERIA (evaluate each, be PERMISSIVE):
1. PATIENT DATA: Does it involve treating patients with the drug?
   - YES: Any mention of patients treated, cases described, clinical experience
   - YES: Single case ("a patient", "a woman"), case series ("5 patients"), cohort ("n=50")
   - NO: Only theoretical discussion, only mechanism/binding studies

2. CLINICAL OUTCOMES: Does it report ANY treatment outcomes?
   - YES: Response rates, improvement, remission, efficacy, outcomes, benefit, response
   - YES: Even qualitative outcomes like "improved", "responded", "effective"
   - NO: Only study protocol, only pharmacokinetics without efficacy

3. OFF-LABEL USE: Is this about a non-approved indication?
   - YES: Disease is NOT in the approved indications list below
   - NO: Disease is CLEARLY one of: {{ exclude_indications }}
   - WHEN IN DOUBT: Mark YES (include for further analysis)

4. ORIGINAL DATA: Is this primary/original patient data?
   - YES: Case report, case series, retrospective study, cohort study, clinical trial
   - YES: "our experience", "we treated", "patients received"
   - NO: ONLY if explicitly a "review article", "meta-analysis", "systematic review", "guidelines"

DECISION RULES:
- Include if criteria 1, 2, and 4 are YES, AND criterion 3 is YES or UNCLEAR
- When uncertain about any criterion, LEAN TOWARD INCLUDING the paper
- Better to include borderline papers (they will be filtered during extraction)
- Only exclude papers that CLEARLY fail multiple criteria

For each paper, provide your reasoning in the "reason" field, referencing which criteria were met or failed.

INCLUDE papers that have ALL of the above:
- Case reports or case series with patient outcomes
- Retrospective observational studies with efficacy data
- Prospective cohort studies with treatment outcomes
- Compassionate use / expanded access reports with results
- Real-world evidence with response rates
- Studies labeled "experience with" or "treated with" that report outcomes
- Single-center or multi-center case series
- **INVESTIGATOR-SPONSORED RCTs** - Academic/independent randomized trials conducted by researchers at universities or medical centers (NOT funded by drug manufacturer)
- **Pilot studies or feasibility trials** from academic institutions

EXCLUDE these paper types (even if they have patient data):
- **MANUFACTURER-SPONSORED RCTs** - Industry-funded trials, especially those with formal trial names (e.g., BEACON, BREVITY, RA-BEAM, etc.)
- **Pivotal trials or registration trials** - Studies designed for regulatory approval (FDA/EMA submission)
- **Phase 2b or Phase 3 trials with commercial sponsors** - Large-scale trials funded by pharmaceutical companies
- **Industry-funded post-marketing studies** - Phase 4 trials sponsored by manufacturers
- Reviews, guidelines, consensus statements, position papers
- Basic science / mechanistic studies without patients treated
- Pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics studies without clinical efficacy
- Drug monitoring / analytical method papers
- Studies ONLY about approved indications: {{ exclude_indications }}
- Safety-only studies without efficacy outcomes
- Clinical trial protocols (not results)
- Letters/editorials without original patient data
- In vitro or animal studies only

KEY DISTINCTION: We want to INCLUDE investigator-initiated/academic research (even if randomized) but EXCLUDE manufacturer-sponsored commercial trials.

CRITICAL EXCLUSION PATTERNS (check abstract/title carefully):

**INDUSTRY SPONSORSHIP DETECTION** - EXCLUDE if ANY of these appear:
- "FUNDING:" or "Funded by" followed by a pharmaceutical company name
- "Supported by" followed by a company name (Pfizer, Eli Lilly, AbbVie, Novartis, Roche, BMS, Merck, GSK, AstraZeneca, Sanofi, Gilead, Amgen, Biogen, Regeneron, etc.)
- "sponsored by [pharma company]"
- Formal trial acronyms in ALL CAPS (BEACON, BREVITY, RA-BEAM, OPAL, ORAL, SELECT, etc.)
- "Phase 2" or "Phase 3" with >100 patients and multiple centers
- "registration trial" or "pivotal trial"

**PROTOCOL PAPER DETECTION** - EXCLUDE if paper describes a planned study without results:
- Title contains "study design", "protocol", "rationale" without mentioning results
- Abstract says "will be conducted", "is planned", "will evaluate", "aims to assess"
- No efficacy results mentioned (no response rates, no outcomes, no "achieved", no "showed")
- Only describes methodology, endpoints, sample size calculations
- Registered trial mentioned but no results reported

Signs of investigator-sponsored trials (INCLUDE these):
- Single academic center, "investigator-initiated", smaller sample sizes (<50 patients)
- No formal trial name, funded by grants/foundations/NIH
- University or hospital as the only affiliation

    "evaluations": [
        {"paper_index": 1, "include": true, "reason": "Case series with 15 patients showing 80% response rate in dermatomyositis", "disease": "dermatomyositis", "patient_count": 15},
        {"paper_index": 2, "include": false, "reason": "Review article summarizing literature, no original patient data", "disease": null, "patient_count": null},
        ...
    ]
}

PATIENT COUNT EXTRACTION (CRITICAL):
For each included paper, extract patient_count from the title/abstract:
- "10 patients with X" → patient_count: 10
- "a series of 15 patients" → patient_count: 15
- "n=20" → patient_count: 20
- "a case of" or "a patient with" → patient_count: 1
- "5/8 patients responded" → patient_count: 8 (use denominator)
- If unclear, use null

Evaluate ALL {{ batch_size }} papers. When in doubt, include borderline papers for downstream filtering.
