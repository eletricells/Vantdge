Return JSON with disease information:
{
    "disease": "canonical disease name (e.g., 'Dermatomyositis', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis')",
    "disease_subtype": "subtype if applicable (e.g., 'Amyopathic', 'Anti-MDA5', 'Seropositive') or null",
    "disease_category": "therapeutic area (e.g., 'Inflammatory Myopathies', 'Rheumatic Diseases')",
    "disease_raw": "exact text as written in paper",
    "status": "RELEVANT" or "APPROVED_INDICATION" or "UNKNOWN"
}

DISEASE/SUBTYPE SEPARATION GUIDE:
Always separate the base disease from its subtype:
- "amyopathic dermatomyositis" → disease: "Dermatomyositis", disease_subtype: "Amyopathic"
- "anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis" → disease: "Dermatomyositis", disease_subtype: "Anti-MDA5"
- "juvenile dermatomyositis" → disease: "Dermatomyositis", disease_subtype: "Juvenile"
- "seropositive rheumatoid arthritis" → disease: "Rheumatoid Arthritis", disease_subtype: "Seropositive"
- "lupus nephritis class IV" → disease: "Lupus Nephritis", disease_subtype: "Class IV"
- "relapsing-remitting MS" or "RRMS" → disease: "Multiple Sclerosis", disease_subtype: "Relapsing-Remitting"
- "generalized myasthenia gravis" → disease: "Myasthenia Gravis", disease_subtype: "Generalized"
- "plaque psoriasis" → disease: "Psoriasis", disease_subtype: "Plaque"

CRITICAL - DISEASE SPECIFICITY RULES:
NEVER use broad categories as the disease name. Always extract the SPECIFIC condition being treated:

BAD (too broad):
- "Immune-Related Adverse Events" → Extract the SPECIFIC irAE (colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, etc.)
- "Adverse Events" → Extract what condition is being treated
- "Complications" → Extract the specific complication
- "Side Effects" → Extract what is being treated

GOOD (specific):
- irAE colitis → disease: "Colitis", disease_subtype: "Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced"
- irAE hepatitis → disease: "Hepatitis", disease_subtype: "Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced"
- irAE pneumonitis → disease: "Pneumonitis", disease_subtype: "Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced"
- irAE myocarditis → disease: "Myocarditis", disease_subtype: "Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced"
- Graft-versus-host disease → disease: "Graft-versus-Host Disease", disease_subtype: "Acute" or "Chronic"
- Cytokine release syndrome → disease: "Cytokine Release Syndrome"

Disease categories include:
- Inflammatory Myopathies (DM, PM, IBM)
- Rheumatic Diseases (RA, PsA, AS, gout, OA)
- Dermatologic Diseases (psoriasis, AD, vitiligo, hidradenitis)
- Respiratory Diseases (asthma, COPD, IPF)
- Neurological Diseases (MS, NMOSD, MG, ALS)
- Gastrointestinal Diseases (Crohn's, UC, celiac)
- Hematologic Diseases (ITP, PNH, CAD, myelofibrosis)
- Vasculitis (AAV, GCA, Behcet's)
- Lupus (SLE, lupus nephritis, cutaneous lupus)
- Autoimmune Diseases (Sjogren's, SSc)

If multiple diseases are mentioned, extract the PRIMARY one being treated.
If this is about an APPROVED indication, set status="APPROVED_INDICATION".
If you cannot determine the disease, set status="UNKNOWN".
