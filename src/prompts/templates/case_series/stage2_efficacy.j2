Extract ALL efficacy endpoints from this case report/series about {{ drug_name }}.

DRUG: {{ drug_name }}
MECHANISM: {{ mechanism }}
IDENTIFIED EFFICACY TABLES: {{ efficacy_tables }}

PAPER CONTENT:
{{ paper_content }}

Extract EVERY efficacy outcome mentioned, including:
- Primary endpoints (main outcome measures)
- Secondary endpoints (additional measures)
- Response rates and responder analyses
- Disease activity scores (before/after)
- Quality of life measures
- Biomarker changes
- Time to response
- Duration of response

CRITICAL: Extract ALL numerical values. Look carefully for:
- N (total patients evaluated for each endpoint)
- Number of responders and percentage
- Baseline and final/post-treatment values
- Change from baseline (absolute and %)

CRITICAL - TOTAL_N EXTRACTION (DO NOT LEAVE AS NULL):
For EVERY endpoint, extract total_n (number of patients evaluated for that endpoint).

EXTRACT TOTAL_N FROM:
1. Response fractions: "4/5 achieved response" → total_n: 5
2. Percentages with N: "80% (n=10) responded" → total_n: 10
3. Explicit statements: "Of the 12 patients, 8 achieved..." → total_n: 12
4. Table denominators: Look for N column or footnotes stating evaluable patients
5. Baseline N: If per-endpoint N not stated, use overall study N

HANDLING DIFFERENT DENOMINATORS:
- Some patients may be unevaluable for certain endpoints (discontinued, missing data)
- If endpoint N differs from baseline N, note this in "notes" field
- Example: "12 enrolled, 10 completed Week 12" → total_n: 10 for Week 12 endpoints

NEVER leave total_n as null if ANY denominator or patient count is extractable.
If truly unknown, use overall study N as best estimate and note "N inferred from study population".

For each endpoint, extract:

    "endpoint_name": "specific name of the endpoint (e.g., EASI-75, PASI 90, ACR50)",
    "endpoint_category": "Primary" or "Secondary" or "Exploratory",

    "is_validated_instrument": true/false,
    "instrument_quality_tier": 1-3 (1=gold standard, 2=validated PRO, 3=investigator-assessed),
    "is_biomarker": true/false (true if this is a laboratory biomarker like CRP, LDH, complement, cytokines, autoantibodies, etc.),
    "notes": "additional context"
}

ORGAN DOMAIN CLASSIFICATION GUIDE:
- Musculoskeletal: Joint counts, ACR responses, DAS28, SPARCC, myositis measures (MMT8, CMAS), bone density
- Mucocutaneous: Skin scores (EASI, PASI, mRODNAN, CDASI), alopecia (SALT), oral ulcers, Raynaud's
- Renal: Proteinuria, eGFR, creatinine, complete/partial renal response, lupus nephritis measures
- Neurological: Cognitive assessments, neuropathy scores, seizure frequency, MS measures (EDSS)
- Hematological: Platelet counts, hemoglobin, WBC, lymphocyte subsets, complement levels
- Cardiopulmonary: Echo findings, PFTs (FVC, DLCO), 6MWD, PAH measures, ILD progression
- Immunological: Autoantibodies, cytokines, interferon signature, B-cell counts
- Systemic: Composite disease activity (SLEDAI, BILAG, PGA), flare rates, remission
- Gastrointestinal: IBD scores (Mayo, CDAI), hepatic enzymes, dysphagia
- Ocular: Uveitis activity, visual acuity, scleritis measures
- Constitutional: Fatigue (FACIT-F), fever, weight, sleep quality

INSTRUMENT QUALITY TIERS:
- Tier 1 (Gold Standard): EASI, PASI, SLEDAI-2K, ACR20/50/70, DAS28, CDASI, SALT, Mayo Score
- Tier 2 (Validated PRO): DLQI, FACIT-F, SF-36, HAQ-DI, patient VAS, PtGA
- Tier 3 (Investigator-Assessed): PGA, clinical response (unvalidated), "improvement" without scale

BIOMARKER IDENTIFICATION:
Set is_biomarker=true for laboratory measurements that indicate disease activity or treatment response:
- Inflammatory markers: CRP, ESR, ferritin
- Enzymes: LDH, CK (creatine kinase), CPK, aldolase, AST, ALT
- Complement: C3, C4, CH50, MAC (membrane attack complex)
- Cytokines/chemokines: IL-6, TNF-alpha, CXCL9, CXCL10, interferon signature, STAT1
- Autoantibodies: ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-Jo-1, anti-MDA5, anti-Mi-2
- Hematology: Platelet count, hemoglobin, WBC, lymphocyte subsets, CD19/CD20 B-cells
- Renal: Proteinuria, eGFR, creatinine
- Other: Albumin, IgG levels, sIL-2R

IMPORTANT: Biomarker changes can support drug mechanism even without clinical improvement. Always extract biomarker data when present.

EXAMPLE - If paper says "4 of 5 patients (80%) achieved EASI-75 at week 12":
{
    "endpoint_name": "EASI-75",
    "endpoint_category": "Primary",
    "timepoint": "Week 12",
    "measurement_type": "Responder",
    "total_n": 5,
    "total_n_source": "response fraction '4 of 5'",
    "responders_n": 4,
    "responders_pct": 80.0
}

EXAMPLE - If paper says "EASI score decreased from 28.5 to 8.2 (71% reduction)":
{
    "endpoint_name": "EASI score",
    "endpoint_category": "Primary",
    "baseline_value": 28.5,
    "final_value": 8.2,
    "change_from_baseline": -20.3,
    "change_pct": -71.0,
    "is_biomarker": false
}

EXAMPLE - If paper says "CXCL9 levels decreased from 1850 to 420 pg/mL (p<0.05)":
{
    "endpoint_name": "CXCL9",
    "endpoint_category": "Secondary",
    "baseline_value": 1850,
    "final_value": 420,
    "change_from_baseline": -1430,
    "change_pct": -77.3,
    "unit": "pg/mL",
    "p_value": "<0.05",
    "statistical_significance": true,
    "organ_domain": "Immunological",
    "is_biomarker": true,
    "notes": "Cytokine marker of interferon pathway activity"
}

HANDLING MULTIPLE TIMEPOINTS:
If the same endpoint is measured at multiple timepoints, create SEPARATE entries for each:
- "EASI-75 at Week 4" → one entry
- "EASI-75 at Week 12" → another entry
- "EASI-75 at Week 24" → another entry

Return JSON array of ALL endpoints found:
[
    {endpoint 1},
    {endpoint 2},
    ...
]

Be thorough - extract every quantitative outcome with all available numerical data.
