Extract ALL efficacy endpoints from this case report/series about {{ drug_name }}.

DRUG: {{ drug_name }}
MECHANISM: {{ mechanism }}
IDENTIFIED EFFICACY TABLES: {{ efficacy_tables }}

PAPER CONTENT:
{{ paper_content }}

Extract EVERY efficacy outcome mentioned, including:
- Primary endpoints (main outcome measures)
- Secondary endpoints (additional measures)
- Response rates and responder analyses
- Disease activity scores (before/after)
- Quality of life measures
- Biomarker changes
- Time to response
- Duration of response

CRITICAL: Extract ALL numerical values. Look carefully for:
- N (total patients evaluated for each endpoint)
- Number of responders and percentage
- Baseline and final/post-treatment values
- Change from baseline (absolute and %)

For each endpoint, extract:
{
    "endpoint_name": "specific name of the endpoint (e.g., EASI-75, PASI 90, ACR50)",
    "endpoint_category": "Primary" or "Secondary" or "Exploratory",
    "timepoint": "when measured (e.g., Week 12, Month 6)",
    "measurement_type": "Responder" or "Change from baseline" or "Absolute value",
    "value": numerical value or null,
    "unit": "unit of measurement",
    "total_n": total number of patients evaluated for this endpoint (REQUIRED if available),
    "responders_n": number of patients who achieved response (e.g., 4 out of 5),
    "responders_pct": percentage of responders (e.g., 80.0 for 80%),
    "baseline_value": baseline/pre-treatment value or null,
    "final_value": final/post-treatment value or null,
    "change_from_baseline": absolute change value or null,
    "change_pct": percentage change or null,
    "p_value": "p-value if reported" or null,
    "statistical_significance": true/false/null,
    "organ_domain": "one of: Musculoskeletal | Mucocutaneous | Renal | Neurological | Hematological | Cardiopulmonary | Immunological | Systemic | Gastrointestinal | Ocular | Constitutional",
    "is_validated_instrument": true/false,
    "instrument_quality_tier": 1-3 (1=gold standard, 2=validated PRO, 3=investigator-assessed),
    "notes": "additional context"
}

ORGAN DOMAIN CLASSIFICATION GUIDE:
- Musculoskeletal: Joint counts, ACR responses, DAS28, SPARCC, myositis measures (MMT8, CMAS), bone density
- Mucocutaneous: Skin scores (EASI, PASI, mRODNAN, CDASI), alopecia (SALT), oral ulcers, Raynaud's
- Renal: Proteinuria, eGFR, creatinine, complete/partial renal response, lupus nephritis measures
- Neurological: Cognitive assessments, neuropathy scores, seizure frequency, MS measures (EDSS)
- Hematological: Platelet counts, hemoglobin, WBC, lymphocyte subsets, complement levels
- Cardiopulmonary: Echo findings, PFTs (FVC, DLCO), 6MWD, PAH measures, ILD progression
- Immunological: Autoantibodies, cytokines, interferon signature, B-cell counts
- Systemic: Composite disease activity (SLEDAI, BILAG, PGA), flare rates, remission
- Gastrointestinal: IBD scores (Mayo, CDAI), hepatic enzymes, dysphagia
- Ocular: Uveitis activity, visual acuity, scleritis measures
- Constitutional: Fatigue (FACIT-F), fever, weight, sleep quality

INSTRUMENT QUALITY TIERS:
- Tier 1 (Gold Standard): EASI, PASI, SLEDAI-2K, ACR20/50/70, DAS28, CDASI, SALT, Mayo Score
- Tier 2 (Validated PRO): DLQI, FACIT-F, SF-36, HAQ-DI, patient VAS, PtGA
- Tier 3 (Investigator-Assessed): PGA, clinical response (unvalidated), "improvement" without scale

EXAMPLE - If paper says "4 of 5 patients (80%) achieved EASI-75 at week 12":
{
    "endpoint_name": "EASI-75",
    "endpoint_category": "Primary",
    "timepoint": "Week 12",
    "measurement_type": "Responder",
    "total_n": 5,
    "responders_n": 4,
    "responders_pct": 80.0
}

EXAMPLE - If paper says "EASI score decreased from 28.5 to 8.2 (71% reduction)":
{
    "endpoint_name": "EASI score",
    "endpoint_category": "Primary",
    "baseline_value": 28.5,
    "final_value": 8.2,
    "change_from_baseline": -20.3,
    "change_pct": -71.0
}

Return JSON array of ALL endpoints found:
[
    {endpoint 1},
    {endpoint 2},
    ...
]

Be thorough - extract every quantitative outcome with all available numerical data.
