Extract clinical trial pipeline data for {{ disease }}.

=== PHASE FILTER ===
Include ONLY: Phase 2, Phase 2/3, and Phase 3 trials
Exclude: Phase 1, Phase 4, preclinical trials

=== ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT FILTER (CRITICAL) ===
We want drugs that are STILL IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT, not abandoned programs.
PRIORITIZE in this order:
1. Currently recruiting trials (highest priority)
2. Active, not recruiting (ongoing)
3. Not yet recruiting (upcoming)
4. Recently completed trials (within last 2 years) - still indicates active development
EXCLUDE:
- Trials completed more than 2 years ago (likely abandoned or approved)
- Terminated/Withdrawn trials (development stopped)
- Suspended trials

{% if ct_gov_data %}
=== CLINICALTRIALS.GOV API DATA (PRIMARY SOURCE) ===
This is authoritative structured data from ClinicalTrials.gov.
Note: "is_active_development" field indicates if this represents current pipeline activity.
{{ ct_gov_data | to_json }}

Use this as your primary source. Check "is_active_development" and "status" fields.
{% endif %}

=== WEB SEARCH RESULTS (SUPPLEMENTARY) ===
Use these to fill gaps (mechanisms, company names, trial acronyms):
{{ search_results | to_json }}

=== EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS ===

1. PRIORITIZE ClinicalTrials.gov API data when available
2. CHECK "is_active_development" field - only include trials marked as true
3. VERIFY dates: trials should have start dates within last 5 years OR be actively recruiting
4. For each drug, try to determine:
   - The INN (generic name) if available, otherwise use company code (e.g., VAY736)
   - Sponsor company
   - Mechanism of action
   - Any regulatory designations (Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, Orphan)

5. CROSS-REFERENCE: If web search mentions drugs NOT in the API data, include them with trial_id="Unknown - verify"

For each pipeline therapy, extract:
{
    "drug_name": "Drug name (INN preferred, or company code like 'VAY736')",
    "company": "Sponsor company name",
    "mechanism": "Mechanism of action (e.g., 'Anti-BAFF-R monoclonal antibody', 'JAK inhibitor')",
    "phase": "Phase 2" or "Phase 3" or "Phase 2/3",
    "trial_id": "NCT number (REQUIRED when available)",
    "trial_name": "Trial acronym if known (e.g., 'NEPTUNUS', 'DAHLIAS', 'TULIP')",
    "status": "Recruiting" or "Active" or "Not yet recruiting",
    "expected_completion": "Expected primary completion date (YYYY-MM) or null",
    "regulatory_designations": "BTD, Fast Track, Orphan Drug, or null",
    "notes": "Any important context (e.g., 'Positive Phase 2 results reported')"
}

Return JSON:
{
    "pipeline_therapies": [
        {therapy 1},
        {therapy 2},
        ...
    ],
    "phase_3_count": integer count of Phase 3 therapies,
    "phase_2_count": integer count of Phase 2 therapies,
    "pipeline_summary": "2-3 sentence summary including: total active programs, key mechanisms being tested, and any upcoming readouts or recent positive results",
    "key_catalysts": "Major trial readouts expected in next 12-18 months, or null",
    "data_completeness": "High" or "Medium" or "Low",
    "data_completeness_notes": "Explain any gaps (e.g., 'Web search only, no API data available')"
}

=== DATA COMPLETENESS SCORING ===
- High: ClinicalTrials.gov API data available AND web search confirms findings
- Medium: Either API OR web search available with reasonable results
- Low: Limited data found, or significant uncertainty about trial status

=== VALIDATION RULES ===
1. If {{ disease }} is a well-known autoimmune/inflammatory condition and you find <3 Phase 2/3 trials, set data_completeness="Low"
2. Do NOT include trials for different indications even if same drug
3. Do NOT include already-approved drugs (those go in approved treatments)
4. Deduplicate: If same drug appears in multiple trials, list the most advanced phase
