Classify these papers by the primary disease/condition being studied for {{ drug_name }}.

Papers:
{% for paper in papers %}
{{ loop.index }}. Title: {{ paper.title }}
{% if paper.abstract %}   Abstract: {{ paper.abstract[:300] }}...{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

Return ONLY valid JSON mapping paper number to disease:
{
    "classifications": [
        {"paper_num": 1, "disease": "exact disease name"},
        {"paper_num": 2, "disease": "exact disease name"},
        ...
    ]
}

Rules:
- Use standardized disease names (e.g., "Vitiligo" not "vitiligo", "Alopecia Areata" not "AA")
- If a paper covers multiple diseases, choose the PRIMARY one
- If disease is unclear, use "Unknown"
- Group similar conditions together (e.g., all types of eczema under "Atopic Dermatitis")
