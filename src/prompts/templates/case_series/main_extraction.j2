You are analyzing a medical case report/series for drug repurposing opportunities.

Drug: {{ drug_name }}
Mechanism: {{ mechanism }}
Approved Indications: {{ approved_indications }}

Paper:
Title: {{ paper_title }}
{{ content_label }}: {{ content }}

Extract structured data about this case report/series. Focus on:
1. What disease/condition was treated (OFF-LABEL use)?
2. How many patients were treated?
3. What were the efficacy outcomes?
4. What were the safety outcomes?

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE SCORING GUIDE:
- disease_certainty:
  * High: Disease explicitly named, clearly the focus of treatment
  * Medium: Disease inferable but not explicitly stated, or multiple conditions treated
  * Low: Unclear which condition was treated, vague descriptions

- n_patients_certainty:
  * High: Exact number stated (e.g., "n=15 patients", "a case series of 8 patients")
  * Medium: Range given or approximate (e.g., "approximately 20", "15-20 patients")
  * Low: Not stated or unclear (e.g., "several patients", "a few cases")

- efficacy_data_quality:
  * Complete: Primary endpoint with quantitative results, response rates, statistical measures
  * Partial: Some outcomes reported but missing key data (e.g., no denominators, no timepoints)
  * Sparse: Only qualitative descriptions ("improved", "responded well")

- safety_data_quality:
  * Complete: Systematic AE reporting with counts/percentages
  * Partial: Some AEs mentioned but not systematically collected
  * Sparse: Safety not reported or only "well tolerated" statement

CRITICAL:
- Set is_relevant=false if this is NOT about off-label use
- Set is_relevant=false if the disease is one of the approved indications
