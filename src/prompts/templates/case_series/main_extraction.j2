N_PATIENTS EXTRACTION GUIDE (CRITICAL - DO NOT RETURN NULL IF COUNT IS STATED):
Always extract n_patients when ANY patient count is mentioned. Look for these patterns:

EXPLICIT COUNTS (extract the number directly):
- "10 patients with X" → n_patients: 10
- "a series of 15 patients" → n_patients: 15
- "n=20" or "N=20" → n_patients: 20
- "enrolled 25 patients" → n_patients: 25
- "treated 8 subjects" → n_patients: 8
- "12 consecutive patients" → n_patients: 12
- "a cohort of 30 patients" → n_patients: 30

FROM RESPONSE DENOMINATORS (extract total from fractions):
- "10/12 patients responded" → n_patients: 12
- "5 of 8 achieved remission" → n_patients: 8
- "response in 7/10 (70%)" → n_patients: 10

SINGLE PATIENT (case report):
- "a 45-year-old woman" (single patient described) → n_patients: 1
- "we report a case" → n_patients: 1
- "a patient with X" → n_patients: 1

NEVER return n_patients: null if any of these patterns are present in the text.
Only return null if there is genuinely no indication of patient count.

REFRACTORY POPULATION GUIDE (CRITICAL FOR UNDERSTANDING PATIENT CONTEXT):
Identifying whether patients are refractory/treatment-resistant is crucial for interpreting results.

**is_refractory**: Set to TRUE if ANY of these indicators are present:
- "refractory", "treatment-resistant", "treatment-refractory"
- "failed prior therapy", "inadequate response to", "non-responders to"
- "resistant to conventional treatment", "failed standard of care"
- Multiple prior treatments listed as failed
- "difficult-to-treat", "recalcitrant"

**prior_therapy_lines**: Count distinct therapy lines failed:
- "failed methotrexate" → 1
- "failed methotrexate and TNF inhibitor" → 2
- "failed multiple biologics" → estimate 2-3 unless specified
- "treatment-naive" or "no prior biologics" → 0

**refractory_to**: Extract specific drugs/classes they failed:
- "failed rituximab and cyclophosphamide" → ["rituximab", "cyclophosphamide"]
- "refractory to conventional DMARDs" → ["conventional DMARDs"]
- "inadequate response to anti-TNF therapy" → ["anti-TNF"]
- Include drug classes when specific drugs not named

**population_type** classification:
- "treatment-naive": No prior systemic therapy for this condition
- "inadequate-responders": 1-2 prior therapies with suboptimal response
- "refractory": Failed 2+ therapies, clearly stated as refractory
- "highly-refractory": Failed 3+ therapies OR explicitly called highly refractory

**disease_severity**: Look for explicit severity descriptors:
- "mild", "moderate", "severe" - use these if stated
- "active disease", "flaring" → typically moderate-severe
- "rapidly progressive" → severe
- If mixed population (e.g., "mild to moderate"), use "mixed"

EXAMPLES:
- "15 patients with dermatomyositis refractory to corticosteroids and at least one immunosuppressant"
  → is_refractory: true, prior_therapy_lines: 2, refractory_to: ["corticosteroids", "immunosuppressants"], population_type: "refractory"

- "Treatment-naive patients with early RA"
  → is_refractory: false, prior_therapy_lines: 0, population_type: "treatment-naive"

- "Patients who failed anti-TNF, rituximab, and tocilizumab"
  → is_refractory: true, prior_therapy_lines: 3, refractory_to: ["anti-TNF", "rituximab", "tocilizumab"], population_type: "highly-refractory"

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE SCORING GUIDE:
- disease_certainty:
  * High: Disease explicitly named, clearly the focus of treatment
  * Medium: Disease inferable but not explicitly stated, or multiple conditions treated
  * Low: Unclear which condition was treated, vague descriptions

- n_patients_certainty:
  * High: Exact number stated (e.g., "n=15 patients", "a case series of 8 patients")
  * Medium: Range given or approximate (e.g., "approximately 20", "15-20 patients")
  * Low: Not stated or unclear (e.g., "several patients", "a few cases")

- efficacy_data_quality:
  * Complete: Primary endpoint with quantitative results, response rates, statistical measures
  * Partial: Some outcomes reported but missing key data (e.g., no denominators, no timepoints)
  * Sparse: Only qualitative descriptions ("improved", "responded well")

- safety_data_quality:
  * Complete: Systematic AE reporting with counts/percentages
  * Partial: Some AEs mentioned but not systematically collected
  * Sparse: Safety not reported or only "well tolerated" statement

CRITICAL:
- Set is_relevant=false if this is NOT about off-label use
- Set is_relevant=false if the disease is one of the approved indications

DISEASE/SUBTYPE SEPARATION GUIDE:
Always separate the base disease from its subtype:
- "amyopathic dermatomyositis" → disease: "Dermatomyositis", disease_subtype: "Amyopathic"
- "anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis" → disease: "Dermatomyositis", disease_subtype: "Anti-MDA5"
- "juvenile dermatomyositis" → disease: "Dermatomyositis", disease_subtype: "Juvenile"
- "seropositive rheumatoid arthritis" → disease: "Rheumatoid Arthritis", disease_subtype: "Seropositive"
- "lupus nephritis class IV" → disease: "Lupus Nephritis", disease_subtype: "Class IV"
- "relapsing-remitting MS" → disease: "Multiple Sclerosis", disease_subtype: "Relapsing-Remitting"
- "generalized myasthenia gravis" → disease: "Myasthenia Gravis", disease_subtype: "Generalized"
- "plaque psoriasis" → disease: "Psoriasis", disease_subtype: "Plaque"

CRITICAL - DISEASE SPECIFICITY RULES:
NEVER use broad categories as the disease name. Always extract the SPECIFIC condition being treated:

BAD (too broad):
- "Immune-Related Adverse Events" → Extract the SPECIFIC irAE (colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, etc.)
- "Adverse Events" → Extract what condition is being treated
- "Complications" → Extract the specific complication
- "Side Effects" → Extract what is being treated

GOOD (specific):
- irAE colitis → disease: "Colitis", disease_subtype: "Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced"
- irAE hepatitis → disease: "Hepatitis", disease_subtype: "Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced"
- irAE pneumonitis → disease: "Pneumonitis", disease_subtype: "Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced"
- irAE myocarditis → disease: "Myocarditis", disease_subtype: "Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced"
- irAE arthritis → disease: "Arthritis", disease_subtype: "Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced"
- Graft-versus-host disease → disease: "Graft-versus-Host Disease", disease_subtype: "Acute" or "Chronic"
- Cytokine release syndrome → disease: "Cytokine Release Syndrome"

If multiple irAEs are treated in the paper, use the PRIMARY condition or "Multiple Immune-Related Adverse Events" as disease_subtype with the most common specific irAE as the disease.

MULTIPLE DISEASES GUIDE:
Many papers study the drug in MULTIPLE diseases (e.g., CAR-T for both SLE and rheumatoid arthritis in the same paper).
- Set "disease" to the PRIMARY disease (most patients or most focus)
- Use "additional_diseases" array for ALL other diseases mentioned with clinical data
- Include each disease even if only a few patients (e.g., 2 RA patients in a study of 10 SLE patients)

CRITICAL: Extract DISEASE-SPECIFIC efficacy for each additional disease:
- Each disease may have DIFFERENT response rates (e.g., SLE 80% vs RA 60%)
- Extract the specific n_patients, response_rate, and efficacy_signal for EACH disease
- Do NOT assume all diseases have the same efficacy outcomes
- If efficacy data differs by disease, capture it accurately per disease

Examples:
  * Paper: "CAR-T in 15 SLE patients (80% CR) and 10 RA patients (60% response)"
    → disease: "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus", n_patients: 15, responders_pct: 80
    → additional_diseases: [{
         disease: "Rheumatoid Arthritis",
         n_patients: 10,
         responders_pct: 60,
         efficacy_signal: "Moderate",
         efficacy_summary: "60% response rate in 10 RA patients treated with CAR-T"
       }]

  * Paper: "Autoimmune cohort: 8 SSc (75% improved), 5 myositis (100% improved), 3 MCTD (67% improved)"
    → disease: "Systemic Sclerosis", n_patients: 8, responders_pct: 75
    → additional_diseases: [
         {disease: "Myositis", n_patients: 5, responders_pct: 100, efficacy_signal: "Strong"},
         {disease: "Mixed Connective Tissue Disease", n_patients: 3, responders_pct: 67, efficacy_signal: "Moderate"}
       ]

  * Paper: "NMOSD (5 patients, all improved) and MS (3 patients, partial response)"
    → Extract each with specific efficacy data

Disease categories include:
- Inflammatory Myopathies (DM, PM, IBM)
- Rheumatic Diseases (RA, PsA, AS, gout, OA)
- Dermatologic Diseases (psoriasis, AD, vitiligo, hidradenitis)
- Respiratory Diseases (asthma, COPD, IPF)
- Neurological Diseases (MS, NMOSD, MG, ALS)
- Gastrointestinal Diseases (Crohn's, UC, celiac)
- Hematologic Diseases (ITP, PNH, CAD, myelofibrosis)
- Vasculitis (AAV, GCA, Behcet's)
- Lupus (SLE, lupus nephritis, cutaneous lupus)
- Autoimmune Diseases (Sjogren's, SSc)

ENDPOINT NORMALIZATION GUIDE:
Strip disease qualifiers from endpoints:
- "CDASI score - amyopathic DM subtype" → endpoint_normalized: "CDASI"
- "MMT8 for dermatomyositis" → endpoint_normalized: "MMT8"
- "ACR50 response rate" → endpoint_normalized: "ACR50"
- "PASI 75 response" → endpoint_normalized: "PASI"

STUDY DESIGN CLASSIFICATION:
- Randomized Controlled Trial / Double-Blind RCT: Randomized, controlled, often double-blind
- Open-Label RCT: Randomized but not blinded
- Prospective Controlled: Prospective study with control/comparator arm but not randomized
- Prospective Open-Label: Prospective study without control arm
- Retrospective: Retrospective chart review, registry study, or database analysis
- Case Series: Multiple patients without formal study protocol
- Case Report: Single patient (n=1)
- Unknown: Cannot determine from abstract/content

EVIDENCE LEVEL CLASSIFICATION (CRITICAL):
Match evidence_level to study_design:
- "RCT": Any randomized controlled trial (double-blind, open-label, phase 2/3)
  * Keywords: "randomized", "randomised", "placebo-controlled", "double-blind", "phase 2", "phase 3"
- "Controlled Trial": Non-randomized but controlled study
  * Keywords: "controlled trial", "comparator arm", "active control"
- "Prospective Cohort": Prospective observational study
  * Keywords: "prospective", "cohort", "longitudinal", "registry"
- "Retrospective Study": Retrospective analysis
  * Keywords: "retrospective", "chart review", "database", "registry analysis"
- "Case Series": Multiple patients, no formal protocol
- "Case Report": Single patient (n=1)

EXAMPLES:
- "A phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial" → evidence_level: "RCT", study_design: "Double-Blind RCT"
- "This randomized trial compared..." → evidence_level: "RCT", study_design: "Randomized Controlled Trial"
- "In this retrospective analysis of 150 patients..." → evidence_level: "Retrospective Study", study_design: "Retrospective"
- "We report 8 patients treated with..." → evidence_level: "Case Series", study_design: "Case Series"

RESPONSE DEFINITION QUALITY:
- Implicit: Response described subjectively ("patient improved", "clinical benefit observed")
- Author-Defined: Authors defined custom response criteria for this study
- Disease-Specific: Standard disease-specific criteria used (e.g., IMACS, MCID cutoffs) but not regulatory
- Regulatory: FDA/EMA-accepted primary endpoints (ACR20/50/70, PASI 75, EASI 75, CDASI, SRI-4, Mayo Score)

FOLLOW-UP WEEKS CALCULATION:
Convert follow-up duration to weeks:
- "12 weeks" → 12
- "3 months" → 12
- "6 months" → 26
- "1 year" → 52
- "24 weeks" → 24

BIOMARKER EXTRACTION (CRITICAL):
Extract ANY laboratory or biological markers mentioned with quantitative changes:

Common biomarkers to look for:
- Inflammatory: CRP, ESR, ferritin, IL-6, TNF-alpha, cytokines
- Metabolic: C-peptide, HbA1c, glucose, insulin levels
- Hematologic: hemoglobin, platelets, WBC, ANC, lymphocytes
- Autoimmune: ANA, anti-dsDNA, complement (C3, C4), autoantibodies
- Organ function: creatinine, eGFR, proteinuria, liver enzymes
- Disease-specific: interferon signature, STAT1, muscle enzymes (CK, LDH, aldolase)

Extract biomarker if ANY of these are present:
- "CRP decreased from X to Y" → name: "CRP", baseline_value: "X", final_value: "Y", direction: "decreased"
- "C-peptide AUC was 0.65 vs 0.43 (p=0.001)" → name: "C-peptide AUC", final_value: "0.65", p_value: "0.001", is_beneficial: true
- "50% reduction in interferon signature" → name: "interferon signature", change_pct: -50, direction: "decreased"
- "ferritin normalized" → name: "ferritin", direction: "normalized", is_beneficial: true

Set is_beneficial based on clinical context:
- Inflammatory markers decreasing = beneficial (CRP, ESR, ferritin down = good)
- C-peptide preserved/increased in T1D = beneficial
- Autoantibodies decreasing = beneficial
- Organ function improving = beneficial

METRIC TYPE CLASSIFICATION (CRITICAL):
Correctly classify what the reported percentage/rate measures:

**Efficacy Response** - Clinical improvement in disease:
- ACR20/50/70, PASI75, EASI75, CDASI response
- "83% achieved clinical response"
- "10/12 patients improved"
- Change in disease activity scores
- Symptom improvement rates

**Drug Survival** - % patients REMAINING on medication over time:
- "18-month drug survival rate was 20.4%"
- "Drug retention at 1 year: 45%"
- "Persistence rate: 60% at 6 months"
- This is NOT efficacy - it includes all discontinuations (lack of efficacy, side effects, switching, access issues)
- Low drug survival does NOT mean low efficacy

**Remission** - Disease remission specifically:
- "Complete remission in 3/5 patients"
- "Remission rate: 40%"
- Disease-free status achieved

**Discontinuation** - % patients STOPPING medication:
- "Discontinuation rate: 35%"
- "40% discontinued due to adverse events"
- Inverse of drug survival

**Other** - Metrics that don't fit above:
- Quality of life improvements
- Biomarker changes alone
- Composite endpoints

EXAMPLES:
- "The 18-month drug survival rate for baricitinib was 20.4%" → metric_type: "Drug Survival", NOT "Efficacy Response"
- "83.3% of patients achieved clinical response at week 16" → metric_type: "Efficacy Response"
- "Drug retention was 70% at 1 year" → metric_type: "Drug Survival"
- "Complete remission was achieved in 60% of patients" → metric_type: "Remission"
