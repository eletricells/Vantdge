N_PATIENTS EXTRACTION GUIDE (CRITICAL - DO NOT RETURN NULL IF COUNT IS STATED):
Always extract n_patients when ANY patient count is mentioned. Look for these patterns:

EXPLICIT COUNTS (extract the number directly):
- "10 patients with X" → n_patients: 10
- "a series of 15 patients" → n_patients: 15
- "n=20" or "N=20" → n_patients: 20
- "enrolled 25 patients" → n_patients: 25
- "treated 8 subjects" → n_patients: 8
- "12 consecutive patients" → n_patients: 12
- "a cohort of 30 patients" → n_patients: 30

FROM RESPONSE DENOMINATORS (extract total from fractions):
- "10/12 patients responded" → n_patients: 12
- "5 of 8 achieved remission" → n_patients: 8
- "response in 7/10 (70%)" → n_patients: 10

SINGLE PATIENT (case report):
- "a 45-year-old woman" (single patient described) → n_patients: 1
- "we report a case" → n_patients: 1
- "a patient with X" → n_patients: 1

NEVER return n_patients: null if any of these patterns are present in the text.
Only return null if there is genuinely no indication of patient count.

EXTRACTION CONFIDENCE SCORING GUIDE:
- disease_certainty:
  * High: Disease explicitly named, clearly the focus of treatment
  * Medium: Disease inferable but not explicitly stated, or multiple conditions treated
  * Low: Unclear which condition was treated, vague descriptions

- n_patients_certainty:
  * High: Exact number stated (e.g., "n=15 patients", "a case series of 8 patients")
  * Medium: Range given or approximate (e.g., "approximately 20", "15-20 patients")
  * Low: Not stated or unclear (e.g., "several patients", "a few cases")

- efficacy_data_quality:
  * Complete: Primary endpoint with quantitative results, response rates, statistical measures
  * Partial: Some outcomes reported but missing key data (e.g., no denominators, no timepoints)
  * Sparse: Only qualitative descriptions ("improved", "responded well")

- safety_data_quality:
  * Complete: Systematic AE reporting with counts/percentages
  * Partial: Some AEs mentioned but not systematically collected
  * Sparse: Safety not reported or only "well tolerated" statement

CRITICAL:
- Set is_relevant=false if this is NOT about off-label use
- Set is_relevant=false if the disease is one of the approved indications

DISEASE/SUBTYPE SEPARATION GUIDE:
Always separate the base disease from its subtype:
- "amyopathic dermatomyositis" → disease: "Dermatomyositis", disease_subtype: "Amyopathic"
- "anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis" → disease: "Dermatomyositis", disease_subtype: "Anti-MDA5"
- "juvenile dermatomyositis" → disease: "Dermatomyositis", disease_subtype: "Juvenile"
- "seropositive rheumatoid arthritis" → disease: "Rheumatoid Arthritis", disease_subtype: "Seropositive"
- "lupus nephritis class IV" → disease: "Lupus Nephritis", disease_subtype: "Class IV"
- "relapsing-remitting MS" → disease: "Multiple Sclerosis", disease_subtype: "Relapsing-Remitting"
- "generalized myasthenia gravis" → disease: "Myasthenia Gravis", disease_subtype: "Generalized"
- "plaque psoriasis" → disease: "Psoriasis", disease_subtype: "Plaque"

CRITICAL - DISEASE SPECIFICITY RULES:
NEVER use broad categories as the disease name. Always extract the SPECIFIC condition being treated:

BAD (too broad):
- "Immune-Related Adverse Events" → Extract the SPECIFIC irAE (colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, etc.)
- "Adverse Events" → Extract what condition is being treated
- "Complications" → Extract the specific complication
- "Side Effects" → Extract what is being treated

GOOD (specific):
- irAE colitis → disease: "Colitis", disease_subtype: "Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced"
- irAE hepatitis → disease: "Hepatitis", disease_subtype: "Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced"
- irAE pneumonitis → disease: "Pneumonitis", disease_subtype: "Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced"
- irAE myocarditis → disease: "Myocarditis", disease_subtype: "Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced"
- irAE arthritis → disease: "Arthritis", disease_subtype: "Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-Induced"
- Graft-versus-host disease → disease: "Graft-versus-Host Disease", disease_subtype: "Acute" or "Chronic"
- Cytokine release syndrome → disease: "Cytokine Release Syndrome"

If multiple irAEs are treated in the paper, use the PRIMARY condition or "Multiple Immune-Related Adverse Events" as disease_subtype with the most common specific irAE as the disease.

Disease categories include:
- Inflammatory Myopathies (DM, PM, IBM)
- Rheumatic Diseases (RA, PsA, AS, gout, OA)
- Dermatologic Diseases (psoriasis, AD, vitiligo, hidradenitis)
- Respiratory Diseases (asthma, COPD, IPF)
- Neurological Diseases (MS, NMOSD, MG, ALS)
- Gastrointestinal Diseases (Crohn's, UC, celiac)
- Hematologic Diseases (ITP, PNH, CAD, myelofibrosis)
- Vasculitis (AAV, GCA, Behcet's)
- Lupus (SLE, lupus nephritis, cutaneous lupus)
- Autoimmune Diseases (Sjogren's, SSc)

ENDPOINT NORMALIZATION GUIDE:
Strip disease qualifiers from endpoints:
- "CDASI score - amyopathic DM subtype" → endpoint_normalized: "CDASI"
- "MMT8 for dermatomyositis" → endpoint_normalized: "MMT8"
- "ACR50 response rate" → endpoint_normalized: "ACR50"
- "PASI 75 response" → endpoint_normalized: "PASI"

STUDY DESIGN CLASSIFICATION:
- Randomized Controlled Trial / Double-Blind RCT: Randomized, controlled, often double-blind
- Open-Label RCT: Randomized but not blinded
- Prospective Controlled: Prospective study with control/comparator arm but not randomized
- Prospective Open-Label: Prospective study without control arm
- Retrospective: Retrospective chart review, registry study, or database analysis
- Case Series: Multiple patients without formal study protocol
- Case Report: Single patient (n=1)
- Unknown: Cannot determine from abstract/content

EVIDENCE LEVEL CLASSIFICATION (CRITICAL):
Match evidence_level to study_design:
- "RCT": Any randomized controlled trial (double-blind, open-label, phase 2/3)
  * Keywords: "randomized", "randomised", "placebo-controlled", "double-blind", "phase 2", "phase 3"
- "Controlled Trial": Non-randomized but controlled study
  * Keywords: "controlled trial", "comparator arm", "active control"
- "Prospective Cohort": Prospective observational study
  * Keywords: "prospective", "cohort", "longitudinal", "registry"
- "Retrospective Study": Retrospective analysis
  * Keywords: "retrospective", "chart review", "database", "registry analysis"
- "Case Series": Multiple patients, no formal protocol
- "Case Report": Single patient (n=1)

EXAMPLES:
- "A phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial" → evidence_level: "RCT", study_design: "Double-Blind RCT"
- "This randomized trial compared..." → evidence_level: "RCT", study_design: "Randomized Controlled Trial"
- "In this retrospective analysis of 150 patients..." → evidence_level: "Retrospective Study", study_design: "Retrospective"
- "We report 8 patients treated with..." → evidence_level: "Case Series", study_design: "Case Series"

RESPONSE DEFINITION QUALITY:
- Implicit: Response described subjectively ("patient improved", "clinical benefit observed")
- Author-Defined: Authors defined custom response criteria for this study
- Disease-Specific: Standard disease-specific criteria used (e.g., IMACS, MCID cutoffs) but not regulatory
- Regulatory: FDA/EMA-accepted primary endpoints (ACR20/50/70, PASI 75, EASI 75, CDASI, SRI-4, Mayo Score)

FOLLOW-UP WEEKS CALCULATION:
Convert follow-up duration to weeks:
- "12 weeks" → 12
- "3 months" → 12
- "6 months" → 26
- "1 year" → 52
- "24 weeks" → 24

BIOMARKER EXTRACTION (CRITICAL):
Extract ANY laboratory or biological markers mentioned with quantitative changes:

Common biomarkers to look for:
- Inflammatory: CRP, ESR, ferritin, IL-6, TNF-alpha, cytokines
- Metabolic: C-peptide, HbA1c, glucose, insulin levels
- Hematologic: hemoglobin, platelets, WBC, ANC, lymphocytes
- Autoimmune: ANA, anti-dsDNA, complement (C3, C4), autoantibodies
- Organ function: creatinine, eGFR, proteinuria, liver enzymes
- Disease-specific: interferon signature, STAT1, muscle enzymes (CK, LDH, aldolase)

Extract biomarker if ANY of these are present:
- "CRP decreased from X to Y" → name: "CRP", baseline_value: "X", final_value: "Y", direction: "decreased"
- "C-peptide AUC was 0.65 vs 0.43 (p=0.001)" → name: "C-peptide AUC", final_value: "0.65", p_value: "0.001", is_beneficial: true
- "50% reduction in interferon signature" → name: "interferon signature", change_pct: -50, direction: "decreased"
- "ferritin normalized" → name: "ferritin", direction: "normalized", is_beneficial: true

Set is_beneficial based on clinical context:
- Inflammatory markers decreasing = beneficial (CRP, ESR, ferritin down = good)
- C-peptide preserved/increased in T1D = beneficial
- Autoantibodies decreasing = beneficial
- Organ function improving = beneficial

METRIC TYPE CLASSIFICATION (CRITICAL):
Correctly classify what the reported percentage/rate measures:

**Efficacy Response** - Clinical improvement in disease:
- ACR20/50/70, PASI75, EASI75, CDASI response
- "83% achieved clinical response"
- "10/12 patients improved"
- Change in disease activity scores
- Symptom improvement rates

**Drug Survival** - % patients REMAINING on medication over time:
- "18-month drug survival rate was 20.4%"
- "Drug retention at 1 year: 45%"
- "Persistence rate: 60% at 6 months"
- This is NOT efficacy - it includes all discontinuations (lack of efficacy, side effects, switching, access issues)
- Low drug survival does NOT mean low efficacy

**Remission** - Disease remission specifically:
- "Complete remission in 3/5 patients"
- "Remission rate: 40%"
- Disease-free status achieved

**Discontinuation** - % patients STOPPING medication:
- "Discontinuation rate: 35%"
- "40% discontinued due to adverse events"
- Inverse of drug survival

**Other** - Metrics that don't fit above:
- Quality of life improvements
- Biomarker changes alone
- Composite endpoints

EXAMPLES:
- "The 18-month drug survival rate for baricitinib was 20.4%" → metric_type: "Drug Survival", NOT "Efficacy Response"
- "83.3% of patients achieved clinical response at week 16" → metric_type: "Efficacy Response"
- "Drug retention was 70% at 1 year" → metric_type: "Drug Survival"
- "Complete remission was achieved in 60% of patients" → metric_type: "Remission"
