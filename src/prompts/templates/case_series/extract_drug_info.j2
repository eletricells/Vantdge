EXTRACTION GUIDANCE:

GENERIC NAME:
- Use INN (International Nonproprietary Name) or USAN
- Lowercase: "tofacitinib" not "Tofacitinib"
- For biologics, use the INN stem: "tocilizumab" not "Actemra"

MECHANISM EXTRACTION:
Format mechanism descriptions consistently:
- For small molecules: "[Target] inhibitor" or "[Target] agonist/antagonist"
  Examples: "JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor", "PDE4 inhibitor", "S1P receptor modulator"
- For biologics: "Anti-[target] [format]" or "[Target] inhibitor"
  Examples: "Anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody", "Anti-TNF-α fusion protein"
- Include selectivity when relevant: "Selective JAK1 inhibitor" vs "Pan-JAK inhibitor"

TARGET EXTRACTION:
- Use official gene/protein symbols: JAK1, JAK2, IL-6R, CD20, PD-1, CTLA-4
- For multi-target drugs, list all primary targets: "JAK1, JAK2, TYK2"
- Distinguish receptor vs ligand: "IL-6R" (receptor) vs "IL-6" (ligand)

DRUG CLASS:
Use standard pharmacological classes:
- "JAK inhibitor"
- "TNF inhibitor"
- "IL-6 inhibitor"
- "Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody"
- "Calcineurin inhibitor"
- "mTOR inhibitor"
- "PDE4 inhibitor"

APPROVED INDICATIONS:
- Be COMPREHENSIVE - list ALL FDA-approved indications
- Use official indication names from FDA labels
- Format consistently: "Rheumatoid Arthritis" not "RA"
- Include age specifications if relevant: "Atopic Dermatitis (adults and pediatric patients 6 years and older)"
- Separate related but distinct indications: "Ulcerative Colitis" and "Crohn's Disease" are different

COMMON INDICATION FORMATTING:
- "Rheumatoid Arthritis" (not "RA" or "moderate-to-severe RA")
- "Psoriatic Arthritis" (not "PsA")
- "Atopic Dermatitis" (not "AD" or "eczema")
- "Ulcerative Colitis" (not "UC")
- "Ankylosing Spondylitis" or "Axial Spondyloarthritis"
- "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus" (not "SLE" or "lupus")
- "Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis" (not "JIA")
