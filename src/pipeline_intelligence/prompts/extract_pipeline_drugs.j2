Extract all unique drugs being developed for {{ disease_name }} as JSON:

{
  "drugs": [
    {
      "generic_name": "<drug generic/INN name - REQUIRED>",
      "brand_name": "<brand name if known, null if not>",
      "manufacturer": "<company developing the drug>",
      "drug_type": "<mAb, small molecule, ADC, fusion protein, gene therapy, cell therapy, etc.>",
      "mechanism_of_action": "<target and mechanism, e.g., 'IL-17A inhibitor', 'JAK1 selective inhibitor'>",
      "target": "<molecular target, e.g., 'IL-17A', 'JAK1', 'BTK'>",
      "modality": "<biologic, small molecule, cell therapy, gene therapy>",
      "highest_phase": "<Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, Approved, Preclinical>",
      "trial_nct_ids": ["<list of NCT IDs for this drug>"],
      "lead_trial_nct": "<most advanced trial NCT ID>",
      "trial_status": "<status of lead trial: Recruiting, Active, Completed>",
      "enrollment": <enrollment number of lead trial or null>,
      "expected_completion": "<expected completion date or year>",
      "primary_endpoint": "<primary endpoint of lead trial if known>",
      "recent_milestone": "<recent news/milestone if mentioned, e.g., 'Phase 3 topline positive'>",
      "efficacy_summary": "<brief efficacy data if available>",
      "dosing_info": "<dosing if mentioned, e.g., '300mg SC Q4W'>",
      "confidence_score": <0.0-1.0 based on data quality>
    }
  ],
  "extraction_notes": "<any important notes about the extraction>"
}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Only include drugs specifically being developed for {{ disease_name }}
2. Do NOT include drugs for related but different indications (e.g., if extracting for SLE, don't include drugs only for Lupus Nephritis or Cutaneous Lupus)
3. Combine data for the same drug across multiple trials
4. Use highest phase across all trials for that drug
5. generic_name is REQUIRED for each drug
6. Set confidence_score based on data completeness and source reliability
7. Deduplicate - each drug should appear only once
8. Include both approved drugs (if in trials for new indications) and investigational drugs

Output valid JSON only.
