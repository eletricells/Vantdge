{
  "discontinued_drugs": [
    {
      "generic_name": "<drug name - REQUIRED>",
      "brand_name": "<brand name if any>",
      "manufacturer": "<company that was developing it>",
      "mechanism_of_action": "<target and mechanism>",
      "highest_phase_reached": "<Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3>",
      "development_status": "<discontinued, failed, terminated, on_hold>",
      "discontinuation_date": "<YYYY-MM or YYYY when discontinued>",
      "discontinuation_reason": "<reason: lack of efficacy, safety concerns, strategic decision, commercial reasons>",
      "failure_details": "<brief description of what happened>",
      "source_url": "<URL where this information was found>",
      "confidence_score": <0.0-1.0>
    }
  ],
  "extraction_notes": "<any important notes>"
}

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Only include drugs that were SPECIFICALLY being developed for {{ disease_name }} (not related indications)
2. Focus on drugs from pharmaceutical/biotech companies (industry-sponsored)
3. Include the discontinuation date if mentioned
4. Be specific about the reason for discontinuation/failure
5. generic_name is REQUIRED for each drug
6. Include drugs that failed Phase 2 or Phase 3 trials - these are important to track

Common reasons for discontinuation:
- Lack of efficacy (failed to meet primary endpoint)
- Safety concerns (adverse events)
- Strategic decision (company priorities changed)
- Commercial reasons (market viability)
- Regulatory issues

Output valid JSON only.
