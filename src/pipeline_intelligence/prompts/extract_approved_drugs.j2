{# FDA-Approved Drugs Extraction Prompt #}

Extract FDA-approved drugs for {{ disease_name }} from the web search results below.

=== CRITICAL: FDA APPROVAL FOR THIS EXACT INDICATION ===
Only include drugs with FDA approval specifically for "{{ disease_name }}".
Do NOT include:
- Drugs approved for related but DIFFERENT indications
- Drugs only in clinical trials (not yet approved)
- Off-label uses (even if commonly used)
- Drugs approved in other countries but not FDA-approved

Examples of DIFFERENT indications that should NOT be conflated:
- "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus" vs "Lupus Nephritis" vs "Cutaneous Lupus"
- "Rheumatoid Arthritis" vs "Psoriatic Arthritis" vs "Ankylosing Spondylitis"
- "Graves Disease" vs "Thyroid Eye Disease"
- "Dermatomyositis" vs "Polymyositis"
- "Crohn's Disease" vs "Ulcerative Colitis"
- "Primary Sjogren's Syndrome" vs "Secondary Sjogren's Syndrome"

=== WEB SEARCH RESULTS ===
{% for result in search_results %}
Title: {{ result.title }}
URL: {{ result.url }}
Content: {{ result.content[:2000] if result.content else 'No content' }}

{% endfor %}

Extract as JSON:
{
  "approved_drugs": [
    {
      "generic_name": "<INN/generic name - REQUIRED>",
      "brand_name": "<brand name if known>",
      "manufacturer": "<pharmaceutical company>",
      "drug_type": "<mAb, small molecule, etc.>",
      "mechanism_of_action": "<target and mechanism>",
      "approval_year": <year as integer or null if unknown>,
      "fda_indication_wording": "<exact or paraphrased FDA label indication if available>",
      "confidence_score": <0.0-1.0 based on source reliability>
    }
  ],
  "extraction_notes": "<any caveats, uncertainties, or drugs excluded with reasons>"
}

=== CONFIDENCE SCORING GUIDELINES ===
- 0.9-1.0: FDA press release, Drugs@FDA, or FDA label explicitly confirms approval for this exact indication
- 0.7-0.8: Reputable medical source (UpToDate, Medscape, FDA-related news) confirms FDA approval
- 0.5-0.6: Multiple sources mention as "approved" but exact indication wording is unclear
- <0.5: Only generic mentions of approval without FDA/indication specificity - DO NOT INCLUDE

=== RULES ===
1. generic_name is REQUIRED for each drug
2. Only include drugs with confidence_score >= 0.5
3. If a drug is mentioned as "commonly used" or "first-line treatment" but FDA approval status is unclear, do NOT include it
4. Symptomatic treatments count IF they have specific FDA approval for the disease (e.g., pilocarpine for Sjogren's dry mouth)
5. If sources conflict about approval status, note this in extraction_notes

Output valid JSON only.
