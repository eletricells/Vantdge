{# Extract treatment paradigm for a disease #}

Extract the treatment paradigm for {{ disease_name }} in the United States.

{% if known_drugs %}
=== IMPORTANT: ENRICHMENT MODE ===
The following drugs have already been identified as approved for {{ disease_name }}:
{% for drug in known_drugs %}
- {{ drug }}
{% endfor %}

Your task is to ENRICH this data with:
1. WAC (Wholesale Acquisition Cost) pricing for these drugs
2. Treatment guidelines and sequencing recommendations
3. Combination therapy protocols
4. Off-label uses mentioned in the literature
5. Treatment rate estimates (% of patients treated)

Do NOT focus on discovering new approved drugs - that has already been done.
Focus on finding PRICING, GUIDELINES, and TREATMENT RATES.
{% endif %}

=== SOURCE DOCUMENTS ===
{% for source in sources %}
--- Source {{ loop.index }}: {{ source.title }} ---
PMID: {{ source.pmid or 'N/A' }}
{% if source.authors %}Authors: {{ source.authors }}{% endif %}
{% if source.journal %}Journal: {{ source.journal }} ({{ source.year }}){% endif %}
{% if source.url %}URL: {{ source.url }}{% endif %}

{{ source.content }}

{% endfor %}

=== EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS ===

{% if known_drugs %}
Since approved drugs are already known, focus on extracting:
1. **WAC Pricing**: Monthly cost for each known drug
2. **Treatment Guidelines**: Official recommendations (ACR, EULAR, etc.)
3. **Treatment Sequences**: Which drug classes are used 1L vs 2L
4. **Combination Therapies**: Common drug combinations
5. **Treatment Rates**: What % of patients receive treatment
{% else %}
Extract the standard treatment paradigm organized by line of therapy:
{% endif %}

**First-Line (1L)**: Initial treatment for newly diagnosed or treatment-naive patients
- Typically conventional therapies, immunosuppressants, or standard DMARDs
- Include drug names and classes

**Second-Line (2L)**: Treatment for patients who failed or are intolerant to 1L
- Often biologics or targeted therapies
- Include WAC (Wholesale Acquisition Cost) if mentioned

**Third-Line (3L)**: If applicable, treatment after 2L failure

Rules:
- Focus on US treatment patterns and FDA-approved therapies
- Distinguish between branded biologics and generic immunosuppressants
- For 2L drugs, try to find WAC or annual cost data
- Note if treatment varies significantly by disease severity or subtype
- Extract treatment rate FROM EACH source that mentions it - don't skip sources
- CRITICAL: Include PMID for each source estimate so it can be traced back
{% if known_drugs %}- ENRICHMENT MODE: Focus on pricing, guidelines, and treatment rates - not discovering new drugs{% endif %}
