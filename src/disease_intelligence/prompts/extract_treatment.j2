=== EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS ===

Extract the standard treatment paradigm organized by line of therapy:

**First-Line (1L)**: Initial treatment for newly diagnosed or treatment-naive patients
- Typically conventional therapies, immunosuppressants, or standard DMARDs
- Include drug names and classes

**Second-Line (2L)**: Treatment for patients who failed or are intolerant to 1L
- Often biologics or targeted therapies
- Include WAC (Wholesale Acquisition Cost) if mentioned

**Third-Line (3L)**: If applicable, treatment after 2L failure

Rules:
- Focus on US treatment patterns and FDA-approved therapies
- Distinguish between branded biologics and generic immunosuppressants
- For 2L drugs, try to find WAC or annual cost data
- Note if treatment varies significantly by disease severity or subtype
