{# Extract treatment failure rates for a disease - PER PAPER #}

Extract treatment failure/inadequate response rates for {{ disease_name }}.

For EACH source paper that contains failure rate data, extract the estimate separately.

=== EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS ===

For EACH source paper that mentions treatment failure, inadequate response, or discontinuation:

1. **Classify the failure type** (CRITICAL - do not conflate these):
   - primary_nonresponse: Never achieved adequate response to treatment
   - secondary_loss_of_response: Initial response then lost efficacy over time
   - intolerance: Stopped due to side effects/tolerability despite efficacy
   - discontinuation_any_reason: All-cause discontinuation (includes non-medical reasons)

2. **Capture the clinical endpoint**:
   - Specific measure (ACR50, SLEDAI, remission, PASI90, etc.)
   - How the endpoint was defined
   - Timepoint of assessment (week 24, 6 months, etc.)

3. **Note the denominator carefully**:
   - Who was included in the analysis
   - Sample size (N)
   - Analysis type (ITT vs per-protocol vs as-treated)

4. **IMPORTANT - Separate switching from discontinuation**:
   - Switch rate: patients moving to another therapy (still addressable market)
   - Full discontinuation: patients stopping all treatment (lost from market)
   - These have VERY different implications for market sizing

5. **Standardize timepoints where possible**:
   - Note if rate is at fixed timepoint vs cumulative vs median time
   - 6-month and 12-month rates are most useful for market sizing

6. **Assign quality tier**:
   - Tier 1: RCTs (ITT analysis), large registries (CORRONA, CorEvitas, >5000 patients), systematic reviews with meta-analysis
   - Tier 2: Real-world cohort studies (N>500), claims analyses, post-hoc RCT analyses
   - Tier 3: Small case series (<100), expert opinion, conference abstracts

**Key terms to look for**:
- "Inadequate response" / "insufficient response"
- "Treatment failure" / "refractory"
- "Biologic-eligible" / "biologic-indicated"
- "Drug survival" / "persistence" / "retention"
- "Switching" / "cycling" / "discontinuation"
- "Primary/secondary non-response"
- "Loss of response"

Rules:
- Extract from EVERY source with failure/response data - don't skip sources
- CRITICAL: Distinguish between failure types - primary non-response is NOT the same as secondary loss of response
- Distinguish between 1L and 2L failure rates
- Note if rate is for specific severity (moderate vs severe) or patient subset
- Separate switching (addressable) from full discontinuation (lost)
- If failure rate varies by subgroup, note the range
- Consider both efficacy failure AND tolerability/safety discontinuations
