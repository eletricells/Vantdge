=== FILTERING CRITERIA ===
{% if data_type == "prevalence" %}
**INCLUDE papers that report:**
- US prevalence or incidence data (national or large regional)
- Population-based epidemiology studies
- Claims database analyses with patient counts (MarketScan, Optum, etc.)
- Registry reports with prevalence estimates (CORRONA, CorEvitas, etc.)
- Systematic reviews/meta-analyses of epidemiology data
- CDC, NIH GARD, or patient advocacy organization statistics

**EXCLUDE:**
- Non-US data only (unless explicitly extrapolating to US)
- Clinical trials without epidemiology context
- Case reports or small case series (<50 patients)
- Studies older than 2010, UNLESS:
  - It's the only US population-based estimate
  - It's from CDC, NIH GARD, or national registry
  - It's a seminal paper cited by many subsequent studies

{% elif data_type == "treatment" %}
**INCLUDE papers that report:**
- Treatment guidelines from major societies (ACR, EULAR, AAD, AAN, etc.)
- Standard of care recommendations with evidence grading
- Treatment algorithms with line-of-therapy sequencing
- Real-world treatment pattern analyses (claims, registries)
- Comparative effectiveness reviews

**EXCLUDE:**
- Single drug efficacy studies (Phase 2/3 trials) without treatment context
- Non-US treatment patterns (unless comparing to US)
- Guidelines older than 2019 (treatment landscape changes rapidly)
- Narrative reviews without systematic methodology

{% elif data_type == "failure_rates" %}
**INCLUDE papers that report:**
- Inadequate response rates to specific therapies
- Treatment failure or discontinuation rates with clear definitions
- Drug survival/persistence/retention analyses
- Registry or claims-based treatment pattern studies
- Systematic reviews of treatment response
- RCT data with response rate denominators
- Switching patterns between therapies

**EXCLUDE:**
- Studies reporting ONLY efficacy (response rates) without failure context
- Studies without clear denominator or population definition
- Conference abstracts (unless no full publication exists)
- Studies in highly selected populations not generalizable to practice

{% endif %}

}

**Scoring guidance:**
- 0.9-1.0: Directly answers the data need with high-quality methodology
- 0.7-0.9: Relevant data but methodology limitations or indirect
- 0.5-0.7: Partially relevant, may have useful supporting data
- <0.5: Exclude

**Quality tier predictions:**
- Tier 1: CDC, NIH GARD, systematic reviews, national registries, large RCTs
- Tier 2: Claims databases, patient advocacy data, state registries, cohort studies
- Tier 3: Single-center studies, older estimates, case series
